#Session #FeyWild
>[!danger]- Recap
>Last session can be sumarized by high highs and low lows. We began last session with the strange revelation of your Father being summoned by letter under the false pretense that Xanthe needed help.
>
>Confused the party entered arena specifically with their weapons drawn letting luna know it was no deal. Apolita proposed that since Luna was down an Ally, She could pick anyone from her court in attendance. 
>
>With anger in her eyes she chooses Xander, forcing Xanthe to fight her own father. Bound by his oath to Apolita, Xander was forced to not hold anything back as he takes the stage against his own daughter.
>
>The party entered a sky battle with their own realtives. Stars opened with a power sleep that almost knocked out luna first term, while Xanthe found herself on the backfoot as her father began to launch his Druidic attacks. 
>
>Despite fighting a former champion Xanthe with much force and rage, lifted her father over her head, and proceeded to lay the smack down. Stars was in his own right doing immense amount of damage to Luna. 
>
>As he grew close to victory Luna transported stars to the Cell of mephisto there in his horrific glory stars suffered a mental break. Sanity on the brink stars returned and in one grand flourish, stars summoned his crown, and grabbing her by the throat, he conquered her mind, and ordered her to fall.
>
>On the other side of the arena, Xanthe entered an intense battle with her father, a true blood bath of attacks back and forth with a little bit of lightning involved. It only ended with Xanthe Sweeped the legs of her father, and kicked him down the ripped up platform. With prideful tears Xander loses to his daughter
>
>With victory in hand, the party went to the locker room to decompress as much as they can. The two made peace with each other and their friendship deepened. In his sleep Stars found himself in the Cell of a remorseful Cyric. There at his lowest stars found a friiend in this prime-evil of Pride. Cyric attempted to give stars his best memory while alliving his greatest hardship.
>
>Stars was given an infernal blessing giving stars a strange new type of magic. Now awake he and Xanthe move towards the Autumn tower, to aquire their wish from apolita.
>
> After Arriving they spent their time amongst the other Courtiers asking and making plans with Apolita. After some heated debate and alot of Rizz the decision was finalized. Apolita would use Cadere to hold all Tiefling souls for the next year, buying our party plenty of time to figure out a final resting place. There was a tiny additional clause that would ask apolita to hand pick a certain wood elf, Zatharon. 
> 
> With all taken care of Apolita set to work meeting the conditions of her promise giving the party time to party amongst the Autumn Courtiers. Stars performed a wonderful piece in honor of Xanthe, Xanthe busted out her best dance moves, and all was well until. Felda. For a split second Xanthe saw a glimpse of a saddened Felda which immediately tipped Xanthe off that something was wrong. 
> 
> She got stars attention who in a moment of pure instinct ran to Xanthe grabbed her shoulder and teleported her outside of the tower before a massive magical beam destroyed half of the tower. 


______

Here we pick up, with the sound of wind. Our party is careening towards the ground. Stars holds Xanthe as they crash threw the roof of a nearby building, dealing a heavy 3d6 to stars and 1 d6 to Xanthe. 

Sitting yourselves up you find yourself in Cardere after dark, the only thing illuminating the city are the great fires that are breaking out. There is a cold green light roaring above, as the autumn tower is in flames. You find yourself in the collapsed shop of Dr. Carmine, with no Dr. in sight. 

_____________

A thick Bassey explosion resonates through the floor as you see out a window a massive green beam hits a section of the coliseum. As this fires you see a smaller ships descend down from the dreadnaught towards the coliseum this one seems to be packed full with troops of some kind. 

Behind you lays the chared remains of the Autumn Spire. A thought crosses your mind that Apolita was in there, and despite its total distruction, you get a divine sense that the lady of war is still alive somewhere.
You are wounded in a derelict laboratory as the city you have come to know burns around you. What's running through your heads, and more importantly whats the plan.

### The Steps

- A Commotion is noted at the steps of the coliseum. A massive fight has occurred and you see two ships docked above the square, unloading various weaponry, as troops repel down to the broken cobble streets. one ship seems to be one you saw earliar decending from the dreadnaught, the other appears to be Luna's ship "The Lady Pennance"
- There appears to be a large rebellion of sorts as gladiatorial pit fighters rally to protect civilians. 
	- You See one such Gladiatorial man leading the defense, Xander. They seem to be holding pretty well, and at the moment they have created the Sutu no man's land. From a birds eye view the situation at first glance looks promising, like they push them back thats good, but you see that the emerald invaders are setting up strange infernal weaponry. This could only mean they will attack again, and when they do the gladiators won't stand a chance.
- On the Lady Penance you see Luna is having a heated discussion with some Emerald clade Paladin of Sorts, a discussion it appears she is losing as she storms off towards her captain's quatres 

Seems like it will take a few minutes in which the gladiators are using to patch up and make whatever impromptu defenses they can muster.

`Arcana 14 : this weapon appears to be a smaller lighter version of the weapon aboard the dreadnaught in the sky. Even more interesting upon taking a closer look it appears this device is powered by a nearbye Infernal engine, you can see the various steaming cables run across the ground and up towards the ship. Sitting on the deck is a large mettalic apparatus surrounding a small red glowing cube, Stars you would know this to be the infernal engine, a device made of only the oldest tortured souls in Avernus Their hate so strong it powers imense machines of war.`

>[!info]- Direction this session
>The Direction Im thinking is that Oberon has been infected by uncle and has declared war on apolita with the help of Solair. 
>
>These ships are Zhentilian in design, and were bought at much expense by Star's father. Essentially Oberon and Solair have teamed up and are attacking the city
>
>They Want Apolita and she has been captured and is abord the Dreadnaught. They are thinking that if she watches her city burn She will eventually give in to their demands and give them Apolita's sword.
>
>The Party will have to sneak aboard the Dreadnaught and break Apolita Free
