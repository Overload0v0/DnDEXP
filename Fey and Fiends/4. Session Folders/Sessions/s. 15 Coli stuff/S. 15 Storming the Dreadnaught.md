#### Recap Different this time


>[!info]- REcap
>This recap will be conducted just a little bit, more like a previosly on, as opposed to just recaping the session. 
>
>We flash back through key moments over the last few months of adventuring as you apporach a very deadily encounter with the lord of the hunt. This all began a few days ago in pixie city as you heard some bubbling news about the grand tourney but layer in with that info was a news clipping of Oberon going missing. This info was immediately discarded, as the party devised their way to skip through the Aestas by flying directly to Cadere. 
>
>Unknown to our party the uncle they were chasing went directly to aestas and possessed the lord of the hunt oberon. 
>
>The Party spent their time in the colliseum without much thought of uncle, that waas until they encountered luna. Star's Half-Sister and Malificur of Mephisto. She warned stars that their father had gone off the deep end, and was willing to burn entire countries to save his people. Luna was not completly on board with this, and worked diligiently to circumvent her fathers plans in place of her own. Stars Denied Luna's deal to team up. He would never be beholden to another destiny again. After a victorious win at the tourny the two met with apolita to discuss their wish. However before Apolita could finish the wish, an attack began. A joint operation between the Emerald Enclaave of Oberon and teiflings  of Sol. From abord an airship they rained fire on the city. 
>
>The party made quick plans after making some quick potions. They met up with Xander and his retenui of Galdiators and pit fighters. The Party split up, stars beseached his sister abord her ship, while Xanthe helped her father below. With dedication, bad stealth rolls, and a very dedicated doto the party successsfully thwarted the ground invasion while seizing a vessel. In the midsts of this heated battle Stars made an interesting choice, he put an infernal engine inside his sword creating a terribly cursed sword of suns. Now with Weapons in hand, and wits sharp the party soars towards the dreadnaught
>
>Standing aboard the Lady Penance Stars and luna devised a plan to invade the Dreadnaught that for the sake of posteratity will will devise this plan into a few simple steps. in order of importance. 
>1. Find Apolita (Without her the portals will not open to send the dreadnaught back)
>2. Power down the super weapon (There should be two Infernal engines somewhere on this ship that are powering it)
>3. AVOID OBERON (Oberon has been infected by Uncle's envy he is quite formidable, and will be roaming the ship)
>4. Sieze the helm (If you are gonna successfully crash this ship, you'll have to sieze the helm)

_________
Like last time we begin with the sound of wind, this time not falling but flying. Your aboard a sleak black scooner that cuts through the sky with a vegence towards the ghostly dreadnaught. Aboard behind the helm Luna stares pensively with a small layer of fear underneath her naturally sassy face. As the ship moves forward Stars you stand at the bow of the ship. whats going through your mind. Xanthe you stand in the crows nest, holding a loose dodo feather

`Xanthe you feel the hairs on the back of your neck stand straight up, looking towards the ship, you see a faint green glow growing brighter and brighter You look around the ship and you see Luna seems paralyzed by fear`

>[!danger]- The dreadnaught fight
>The way this will work is that the dreadnaught is about 500 feet away and your ship moves about 125 a turn. This ship does have light cannons, but its highly unlikely you'll be able to fell the ship, but the cannons can be used to hit specific targets. There is also a magic flame in the cennter of the ship that powers the airship. throwing some spells in  it can increase its movement speed of the ship. 
>
>And lastly for whoever is flying the ship you can decide to head straight towards the ship, which will count as a dash action, or you can bob and weave through the buildings below, which isn't as fast but will guarantee you won't get hit but you will have to make a strength check to avoid the buildings
>
>The Cannons abord the ship do 2d20
>The Ship has 100 HP
>
>The Dreadnaughts engines has 300
>
>The Beam does 3 d20s + 5


Thuds, cracks, and stomps as the boots of our gladiator regiment storm the Dreadnaught, Clangs and clash of steel sound off, as they engage the crew aboard. Xanthe You stand next to your father looking down at the  gladiators. Your father looks wide eyed you sense some degree of fear cross face. It takes you a second to register the problem, this ship is not made of normal wood, but instead of living wood. Green pulsing woodlike flesh ebbs and flows from stern to bow. This unholy ship is alive, and even more unsettling near the back of the ship near the captains quaters, you see the flesh has begun to rot with a blackening mold. Whatever is near the captains cabin must be so overwhelmingly horrible, even the ship itself recoils from it.  

Right now the dreadnaught is flying in the air, 

Stars unaware of even the existance of living wood you step on the prow of this ship surveying your surroundings. It is quite unlike anyship you've ever seen. Armed not with cannons, but green tipped balistas, it begs the question of the exact purpose. In the center of the deck sits a magnificent weapon of Terrible design. A dark Peralecent red Cannon, with a strange variety of copper Coils, surrounding the barrel. At the end of the Device is a focusing lense of sorts, with a beautiful green gem about as long as your foot. Lastly you see two red steaming cables that run in opposite directions. One leads to a small locked hatch that decends to bowels of the ship the other leads up a set of stairs towards the helm. Lastly abord the ship following this cable you see yet again another Infernal Engine, something seems a little different about this one. It has the same red glow to it, but that glow is occasionally interupted by these spurtys of Green crackling energy. 

In the midst of all this Stars you see a Teifling Captain at the helm of the ship issuing out orders. 

I'll now turn it over to you guys now, Your in an interesting position, during this great scuffle you believe you could slip by un detected onto the ship

### Below Deck 

Stepping down off the latter you arrive in a 30 foot long hallway that leads to an iron door. On either side of this hallway, there are 6 Cells on either side, and just as you begin to move down the hallway you hear soft whimpering coming from the cells

These cells have nothing but a tiny slit at the top of door, and as you look through the slit, you see a Tiefling woman in tatter clothes, perhaps a nun or priestess. It appears like she is in the midsts of some incredibly slow and horrific transformation. It looks like her left eye has shifted to a bright piercing Purple color and  is growing ever so slowly at this point its about the size of a large balloon and almost complete envelops most features of her face except her mouth which is quickly and rapidly reciting some sort of prayer, while clutching a rosary. (Teir)

Upon a closer look you can see several Rock like spines growing from her back, and Rocky skin working up from below her collar.  `Priestess Bennia Church of Tere`

As you stare at her a low hum begins to resonate from a crystal at the top of the cell. It reaches its Zeneth as a bright rainbow colored beam blasts the entirety of the room, whoever is still looking inside takes a con 20 save.
-Nothic Curse (See secrets and speak to other nothics)

Opening the erie iron door you find yourself in a large cargo hold, its about a two story room, with you standing on a catwalk overlooking the lower level. From this thin catwalk you can see the entire hold, there is a metric ton of iron shackles down there in these large crates. Possibly the most disturbing you notice these large humanoid creatures much akin to the priestess from before except much more developed. They no longer resemble anything of a teifling or human. Now they have one massive purple eye, with long rock covered bodies, with spines and fingures as sharp as knives, They have a collar around their necks with a purple insignia. They set atop these crates, and look out into the room, never blinking or looking away. This is possibly the only reason they have not spotted you yet, but in the midsts of your observations you see a rat scurry across the cargo hold before meeting the gaze of one of these creatures. The humanoid twitches with incredibly speed and stares directly at the rat, before a purple light shines from their eyes. Basking in this light the rat levetates in the air, and practically explodes from pyscic energy.

There are 3 of these Watchers stationed across the room, and their heads are on an ever so slow swivel. It could be possible to sneak past them, but it will be very difficult. It is also worth mentioning Xanthe you feel your proximiety to Apolita is getting stronger and stronger. And lastly there is actually one dead watcher in the lower left hand corner of the room, it looks like it was quitely assassinated by some powerful magic.

### Mechanics

3 Nothics in this room

________

After crossing the Watchers room, you open the last door in the depths of this boat. This room appears to be a larger more open, cell easily quadruple the size of the cells you saw earliar. Inside is a lone iron table, and chairs, and apolita seemingly shackled to it with a frozen but incredibly angered face. . in the center of the table sits Apolita's sword a beautiful white hilt that leads a black leather scabbard. While strong apolita has a corruption dagger in her shoulder, the infection is insanely slow, stars this looks incredibly similar to when Xanthe was infected. No where near instantaneous, but ever so slowly. 

You see standing besider he with a radient magic in her eyes is Xena, She appears to be casting some strenuous ritual. That has Apolita in some sort of trance.  
_______

`My fawns, please we don't have much time. Our  queen has been cursed, I've trapped her in a dream for now but if something isn't done she will wake and either succumb to uncle or worse draw the sword.`

`-Nothic Vision- Your vision flashes a hazy purple as you look to apolita. You see a bubbling cauldron of anger. betrayl. Breif visions of Apolita in her youth, playing with her brother oberon. The two simply inseprable, another flash to the death of their father Cerelious, and then another to the war between the two in a thousand year war over their fathers power. millinea of hate blood and sibling feud. She still holds some love from her brother, but the anger in her chest at this betrayl is overwhelming. It appears that Xena is causing Apolita to dream of her youth, a dream of petty sibling arguments and curiousity.`

- The Ways through this: Xanthe draws the sword instead of apolita. and uses its power to Remove the dagger
- The party strong arms the dagger out of her, dc 22. and apolita opens the portal herself.
- They crash the ship and both Apolita and Oberon are infected, they might have to follow their crusade. 

______
`I'm not sure, I'm doing everything I can to hold her. I guess you can take the sword and run get to the house and from there run to flora, now she will turn but she won't be able to wage war on the realms without the sword. You could also try to get the dagger out, but that will be tough. Thats the only thing I can think of the swords got some serious magic but only apolita can use it.

Beautiful is tugging your pant leg stars. She's pointing down the hallway, I think something really ugly is coming. Looking down the hallway, you see Xander beaten and bloody, is fighting with everything he has to hold off Oberon who is simply walking down the hallway throwin Xander around like a rag doll

This being the first time you see him, he is massive easily 8 feet tall, with massive satyr legs of brown fur. He is truely rippling with muscle, but is covered in clumps of black oil like tar a la venom style. He has this massive set of antlers upon his head, and if it wasn't for the tar you would see he has a light green skin tone. He is not dressed fancy but instead incredibly primal. clothing, tattered cloth with beads adoring his antlers. 

He will attempt to fight the party, while Xanthe can figure out what do with the sword.
