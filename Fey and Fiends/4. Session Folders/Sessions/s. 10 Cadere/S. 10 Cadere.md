# Opening:
As Alca and Petunia rush off into the night to cause untold chaos in the dismantling of the society they made together it brings about this strange sense of Emotional healing. Breaking the very thing that drove th ese two apart while violent and highly questionable in terms of Ethics, it does reaffirm the Ideas you had in Hiemsal. 
	You are tired of accepting the problems that are laid out before you, under any circumstances this life is your own and you live it. 

You two stand around this purple bag of glowing white dust that upon contact with your figures begins to travel up you body in a golden ray that gives you a slight glow. Flying is not as laborious as you once thought you simply think of where you want to go as your two bodies rise and soar through the Ver Verian Night. Breaching the Corona of the Tree you see yourself over a impossibly large interconnected forest of beautiful trees and colors that from this height looks more than alive. Its like you can even see the trees breathing from up here. As you look about for directions you do not see trees of orange

Instead you see large mountains with an ever precent beam of sunlight shinning between them. You know this to be the lands of Cadere. You sail towards them all day as your bodies daintily touch traveling clouds of magical crystal droplets. 

During the night you sleep in the massive trees far from the surface and during the next day you break into the mountain pass. As you wind the mountain trails you see a valley of orange trees and clearings of Waste high wheat. A land of permeant sun set framed in the bowl of the orange mountains that surround this Land. What makes this area of the Fey so unique is that it appears to have been at one point civilized. 

Evidence of this is everywhere. You see massive Structures not of Tree or root but of marble and stone. Nothing still stands almost all buildings fallen into ruin. Like this was once the seat of a mighty empire that a thousand years ago disappear. 

Cadere Has plenty of forests and plains of wheat that surround the lining of the Autumn Valley but their is a Beacon of Civility in Cadere's Center.  The City of Elona.  Sandstone Pillars marble arches and Alibaster Statues decorate this truely ancient city. While the Structure is civilized it lacks any and all repairs. Moss, vines and vegetation grow any and everywhere through this city. Buildings crumble, stairs worn to slopes, and quite desolate streets. It looks like a city that hasnt grown or developed in more than a thousand years. However it is clear that pleanty of people live here its just every building is in disrepair 

Stars with little time left on your pixie dust you pick and a spot that catches your eye. A balcony of Broken Purple Mosaic Tiles.

The two of You land on a broken Mosaic  balcony on the southern Side of the City. It looks like it continues inwards towards an empty Flat owned at one time by some noble, It appears fully baren and broken. Looking out you can see dozens of Fall Eladrin that move their way through this city like they would a forest. Comoners climb up walls and move through the city almost like they think the streets below are pointless. 

You stand in an empty Ward of Elona which is quite strange it appears to be opulent and Palace like.

Stars at this point you notice something about the faded and destroyed Mosaic Floor you stand on. A memory of yours springs through your mind. You are a young child  no older than 5. The Memories are disjointed with age but you remembers like all Children Falling about everywhere. Boring afternoons of your father away constantly with his revolution and your mother attending to lesser duties in the Palace. You remember running your fingerers across the grout grooves of the floor over and over. 

Its unmistakable this is some ancient version of your childhood living room realizations begin to connect as you look around. By the time you came of age you and your father lived in the newly liberated rooms of the palace so your only memories of this place were from a whopping height of 4 feet now that you are grown and tall the apartment seems so effortlessly small. This is not just a place you lived once upon a time this was your mothers apartment, but its so wrong it looks like its aged a thousand years.

Walking through the apartment you notice every room is empty but full of memories. 

-Arcana- 13 
	The fey Wild exists not just as its own realm its sits directly on top of the mortal Realm. So places built in the Mortal plane that Last long enough can appear in the Feywild after enough time. Kind of like a light blanket slowly floating down onto you and gently and slowly forming your shape as it lays flat. Looking about the City you notice it looks very similar to the City of Sands Ennu. The Architecture is different and its rotten but it is in the shape of Ennu. Where their would be a monolith here there is a massive tree. It looks so very different but just barely matches the idea of Ennu If you were to find a way out of the Fey you would appear in the mortal realm in the middle of Ennu. 

You two head your way to the inner city of elona as a flock of Tawny Owls pirch up and coo at you two as you walk
##### Roll perception checks - 14 - 
As you begin your trek into town you swear you get the feeling something is moving in the silent and still ruins.

As stars and Xanthe Turn their backs to the outskirts and move towards the inner city of Elona our camera zooms outwards and further outwards to reveal someone is watching them through a oily scope. something begin to chuff as it sprints away towards the city at break neck speeds.

### Moving On

As you walk through the streets of Elona you see a rift open up in the sky as Several flying ships come through its  maw, one is drawn by a chariot of tenctacles another is upheld by Giant balloons. Another is some rudimentary helicopter spitting fire and black plumes of smoke. The Last object coming through the portal doesnt even fly it just plops out of the maw and begins to crash towards the Coliseum. This an infernal contraption erupts in a comical poof of Smoke over the Coliseum walls

____
Walking through the heavily vegitive streets of Elona You find yourself in a Bazaar of sorts. Eladrin and Fey creatures alike find themselves in stalls with a patchwork of Beautifully Dyed Tarps covering the square you find yourself in
