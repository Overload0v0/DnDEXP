#Session 

>[!info]- Recap
>Deep in the Desolate crypts of Caladin a great evil has been stirring. A massive creature of unknown origin, with a barbaric taste for sacrifice. The creature is cared for by a cult of most malicious designs. Any attempt to determine either origin would more than likely bring more questions. This creature of stolen faces as plagued the city of Caladin for an unknown period of time, eating and stealing the dreams and memories of it's residence. There the city sat in its quite decay for a forgotten amount of time until our quaint party of 3 arrived in the City of Emperors. Shrouded in fog they investigated the city to only find more puzzling mysterious around every corner. As they got closer to it's source, they wanted even less to do with it. Before the party could depart for distant shores, Xanthe was abducted by this Dementia Wyrm Memories slowly being siphoned away she awoke in an underground crypt surrounded by the forgotten captives of the memory devourer She banded them all together and began to seek a way out, on the way she encountered non other than Zath as he returned from a scouting mission. With trepidation and many a ruinous theroy The collective banded together and went further into the dungeon of Loss. Angered and in no mood for dilly dallying Stars and Luna rushed through the city, they encountered cultists entering the temple of Tyr dressed in red robes. After disguising themselves as cultists the two head further and further below the chapel until they arrived in a massive ritualistic chamber dedicated to the White Serpant, Oolain. 
>
>Here it was revealed that the Grand cleric was head of this Cult, and performed ritualistic sacrfice down here for an untold amount of time. At the tense moment of reveal, luna and stars began to do battle with the grand cleric and her acolytes. Stars held Galana the treacherous over the pit Oolain before noticing Xanthe skulking about in the dark beneath. We last left off as Galana fell into the mouth of the beast, and our party reunited once again.

The acrid air hangs in a delicate balance around this room of blood and heretical ritual. The room is dark save for the faint glow of red emanating from the bloody sigils across this room. Standing before the Maw of Oolain We see a furious stars covered in dozens of phantasmic Arms that stretch and grasp to lend Stars their strength. He effortlessly dangles a defeated Galana Briar over the sacrificial pit of Oolain. For someone so powerful and wise she desperately pleads and grasps at your arms for support. Her words fall on deaf and raging ears, as the ritual begins to swell stars feels a spit bawl strike his neck. The biggest wave of disgust hits you but as you look down into this dark eldritch pit you notice a set of eyes that are unmistakable to you. Xanthe's. Crouched hidden in the pit of Gore and viscera your elven companion seems no worse for wear. The anger fades and with it your grasp on Galana. As she falls into the many demonic faces of the white serpent the red sigils begin to glow brighter and brighter until an arcane explosion ripples the room into darkness. for all involved a deep magical darkness floods the room, For Xanthe this hits you with a special wave of horror. Just as the darkness begins to overtake the room, you lock eyes for a split second with one of the many eldritch faces stimming from the massive sprawling monster before  you. As darkness consumes the room you hear thrashing and clawing, Xanthe it sounds like the monster is crawling out of the pit. 

What follows is a cacophony of sound and destruction. The grating of Claws on stone, the slashing of meat, and the crunch of bone all accompanied by a symphony of horrific shrills and screams. You hear a massive lumbering body Lerch out of the pit as it begins to destroy the building around you in this darkness. As you stumble about completely blind amongst the overwhelming torrent of hidden destruction around what is the first thing you think to do. Is there anything you would like to do in these moments of helplessness.  

Minutes go by of this horror before you feel the floor to the church above buckle followed by a resounding crash of stone - Dex Save 13 or 2d4 bludgeoning dmg-

### The Beast  Escapes for now.

your not sure how much time passes but eventually you begin to open your eyes. The room is dark now yes, but not longer an intense magical fog, now just the dark of night. Above, you notice the church destroyed as a beam of moonlight shines through the collapsed building. You are able to spot one another in the rubble, Xanthe is crowded by wounded prisoners of the serpent Zath is no where to be seen. 

Perception check 14

As you glance about you notice the fog is gone, and with it a clarity you did not know you had missed. Perhaps this cult was the only thing keeping him on this plane, or perhaps this cult was the only think containing him to this city. It's rather hard to tell. 

Aden is Galan's baby turned cursed snake.
### The Door:
Xanthe here in the lowest part of the now ruined temple, you look about the room perhaps for other exits or simply to get a lay of the newly destroyed land. Just as you begin to gather yourselves together to head out, you notice amongst the ruins of the Crypt a bright shiny red door, completely untouched in the chaos. Its so strange that as you look to it, it almost feels like its always been there in your vision, you just never noticed. Maybe you were not supposed to notice. One thing is clear, any living creature with a soul would know this. You feel a deeply unsettling feeling looking at this door. Maybe millions of years of survival and instincts are speaking but whatever is behind that door is dangerous and primordial. Something you typically were not supposed to see
