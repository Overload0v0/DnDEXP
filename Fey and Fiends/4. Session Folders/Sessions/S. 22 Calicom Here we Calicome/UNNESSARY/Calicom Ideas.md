All surounding some mystery around a club Scion.

- The General Idea is that in order to uncover the plot the party would need to visit all of the interesting points on the map, and maybe all that connects some how. 

HERE IS THE IDEA BIN 
______
- The Golden Touch Casino ran out of abandoned Imperial Fort
- The Bronze Beard Dwarven Camp. (Army Sent by the King of the Mountains to safe guard a dragon invasion)
- The Hook and Eye : Abandoned Bar north of town that hosts undead cliental
- Mr. Carmine's Office (Sol's origin stuff)
- Misty's Orium of Valkur (Closet thing to a Church, Valkur God of Waves and Ship combat)
	- Pirate King's council Area? Pirate King Unknown owner of the Night Runner
- The Shallow end : Funeral Home. 
- The Palms : two Abandoned Ships On the Western Mountain home to a collective of Devilish Children
- Scale guard Keep : Destroyed Mansion Turned into a Forward base camp for Dalen Guardians. 
- The Big Brig : A Strange Ultra-Max Prison Only Accesseable through the Golden Touch Casino... Its only strange because this fort would have no reason to house an empty Prison this elaborate. 
	- Possible Dragon Trapped in the basement Used by Madaam Boodwan in her rituals. 
- The drunken Dragon : Biggest Tavern In town. Most need to know info is found here.

#### Idea Flow
The Party first struggles to find its way through the city of Calicom. I would honestly say Don't even show A map yet, until Sebastian shows you around town

They are latter informed that The madam they are looking for is near deified here and is hosted by the Golden Touch Casino in one of its many rooms. 

Arriving at the Golden Touch Casino, Im thinking entice them into a few games, get them gambling a bit, and the moment they begin to find madam Boodwan screams are accompanied by a large blast. Rushing to the noise its revealed something Took Boodwan. Whatever that something is Its completely untraceable. One they find a way into Boodwan's Room at the Golden Touch they will find a business card relating to a Mr. Carmine

Carmine's Office is an office building of sorts for some old trade house, however every room and office is empty except for the one at the top floor, Sitting alone in this office dressed in an odd suit, is Mr. Carmine. He can give them a tip regarding Boodwan's largely unknown Past Times
	- The Last event on her Itinerary before her abduction was visiting the Palms, A self Run Orphanage in the West   
	- She is not Part of but sits in on meetings in the Orium

### The Palms route
At the Edge of Town where the lights grow dark, and the only thing seperating you and complete darkness is the moonlight shining between the leaves of the trees, They find an old Deralict Pirate ship, with tons of lights on inside it.. Inside the rotted vessel Dozens of Children play games chear and perform all sorts of merriment.
