# Sebastian's Welcome
Your Dragoons Begin docking procedures, This city is not neceserily well built but it is incredibly dense. Right here on beach front its rare to see a single story house, instead massive multistory shacks cover the beach. Behind the ram shackle buildings is a Spire Like Mountain that has this Debaucherous  Civilization clinging to the edges of this jungle ridden mountain. While heavily populated the screams of monkeys and howls of strange creatures resonating from the jungles of this island give an impression that while populated this island is not tamed in the slightest.

Stepping Past the gates You are swarmed with Dozens of Cart Peddlers, beggars, and various different degrees of Sex workers as they begin to all at once solicit you for their services. Leaning on a barrel nearby is a a Tall and well built elf with a Deep Leathery Tan, and a gruesome scar on his right eye covered with an eyepatch. 
He lifts his lumber like an Arm and waves you two over.
