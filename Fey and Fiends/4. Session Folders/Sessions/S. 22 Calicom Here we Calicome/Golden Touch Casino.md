The Golden Touch. 
Two words to describe a place such as this, Opulence, and brutality. Even outside on the steps looking up at the colossal Palace, Warm Golden Light shines down on you, as golden mists of various bottles of champaign pop on the many Verandas and Balconies. The Most Ignominiously Wealthy People you have ever seen Throwing away stupid amounts of Gold and Crowns into this palace of Greed. Stepping inside you feel the thrum of voracious Music Coming from one of the many Dance Halls. The Ever present noise of Coins clinking and jingling together. 

The Crowd roars like an ocean at the varying levels of success at any given table, and I must admit the allure is quite attractive. Only the finest men and women you've ever seen deal these tables of green and gold. Looking around the Casino is quite evident that most of these tables are significantly out of your league. Various Barons of Industry and lofty Lords gamble at the tables above. Moving threw you spot A few different Games to play should you feign some interest.

A few games are going on that are lower stakes but you notice a particularly hot table. You notice a large Pirate easily the size of three men THROW his cards into the table and starts stomping out accompanied by two men at his side. Laughing at the empty seats you see a young man in golden decorative armor with a small crowd behind him watching in awe.

If the dealer scores a 21, all players lose. If a player scores a 21, they win. If neither occurs, a player loses if their total is less than the dealer’s, and wins if their total is greater than the dealer’s. Payout for winning players is 3:2. If both the dealer and a player score a 21, that player wins their bet back 1:1.
>- **Hand of Fate (Min 50 gp buy-in).** A player rolls 1d12 and keeps their roll secret. Each player has the chance to raise the bet, call the bet, or fold. This continues until all bets are equal. A d12 is then rolled which all players can see. Each player has a second chance to raise, call, or fold. A second and final d12 is rolled and each player gets one last chance to raise, call, or fold. Once all bets are equal, all dice are revealed. The player with the highest combined total of their die and the public dice wins 80% of the pot (20% going to the casino). Ties split the 80%.
