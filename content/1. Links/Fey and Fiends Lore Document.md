The World of Fey and Fiends is loosely set in WOTC's Faerun. While borrowing the rough idea of the Sword Coast as a continent, most of this story is set on a different continent called Almyria. 

The Story Picks up in the small town of Cobbleton in the heart of the Empire of Man. With an unlikely duo whose fates are intertwined after the two are chased out of town due to a drunken stupor so legendary neither remembered what happened.

They searched across the continent looking to clear their names, and solve the mysteries of their pasts.
