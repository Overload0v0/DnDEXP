____
###### Recap:
- Time reset as futures divined and pasts left un-augured. Our party opened in a darker version of the Glider Gleam. Light struggled against the enveloping dark gray that absorbed the vast majority of this barren forest. 
- Amongst the Erie trees and gnarled branches our party encountered a campfire in the distance with a constant light teasing of maracas coming from behind Stars. Ignoring the obvious trap to the south our Fey and Fiend trudged their way north to the soft orange campfire nestled beneath the trees. 
- Stars hid his demonic face from the 3 summer elves Boaris Deatri and Allana the Divine Sword wielding Knight of Oberon. 
- They spoke of a oil bound beast of feather and fur somewhere to the north that's behind the disappearance of Flora. 
- After the two parties became one you set off down the trail before arriving at a clearing amongst the gnarled baren branches of twisting rotten trees. A canopy of Rot so thick it blocked out the sky with a dark shadowy path ahead. 
- At the end of this path lay the puppet of uncle, which was quickly spotted by stars as tissues of Sinnue led from the puppets hands to the unseen puppet master that hid somewhere in the trees above them.
- Blood and Viscera rained as battle insued. Casualities and trauma lettered the battlefield. as our elven companions are quickly dispatched boaris butched Detri routed and Allana trembling in fear
- Stars took several mortal wounds etching permenat scars across the face of one Stars
- After magnicicent display of barbarity from Xanthe the beast that called itself uncle was wounded and on its last leg, Stars under command of Xanthe removed a glowing red dagger from his chest. 
- What followed was the rapid decay of the beast in front of you, and with one final cry the animal carcuses that made up its body droped and flopped in piles of oil and sludge revealing that underneath it all was a wounded and possessed flora Gaurdian of the gilder gleam
- Her old form revealed she warned the party that uncle has buisness with apolita in Cardere 
- After helping her back to her old glade, she quickly revitialized the forest and set our two adventures down for a cup of tea some dinner and heavy sleep in the bunk beds
- After some much needed Denomout The party set out the next day with the blessing of a grateful forest before making their way to Ver Veria. 
- While on such Road the party encountered a Road of Iron railings with dwarves pushing and pulling carts. Where they met a Pixe named Alca

## Moving On

`Almost without thought as you trudge through a forest of whysmical personification of Spring, with all plant like features tuned up to a 1000% Before you hear the crunch of thud of your feet on gravel. You find yourself in a ditch of sorts next to massive road, you can see this road cuts through the forest like a knife through butter. Almost sacreligous in a place like this. 

`On this gravel road lined with iron railings you see dwarves in hoods. They were patchwork leather armor and seem a little shady. Which is still mega shady considering dwarves are not from the fey especially not in these numbers. They have black steel wagons pulled by Large Salamanders coming in a wide Variety of color that seem to be un burndoned at the moment fighting over a leaf.`
`
`Off to the right hand side of the road appears to be a table underneath a Gazebow setup in such a way to reflect a temorarary office.

`This outside Desk that sits upon a shag rug is host to a minagre of different currencies and contracts. Several books about Penal Codes and Law referendums scatter the surrounding outdoor office both amongst the carpet floor and several open satchels filled to the brim with loose leaflets and papers.

`A an older looking pixie with long floopy ears no taller than a cofee table sitting behind the desk on a variety of booster seats. He fervently seems to be signing an ever growing pile of papers that is being fueled by a small line of dwarves orderly queued up in front of the table. each holding some form of shipping manifest waiting for this pixies attention. 

`However the only thing that stops his laborious task in front of him and that is you two. The sheer difference in height fixes his eyes on you. The Old Pix clocks you and says "You too You aint with the Caravans Lemme finish payroll and we'll have a chat "`

#### Pixie City Descriptors

Alca offers a ride in his Salamader driven limo of a Carrige. the insides are covered in a lucious and luxurious red velvet sets with red carpet with Pink lettering and Gilding across the interior. The Windows are slightly tinted creating a cozy atmosphere gently lit by a bottle of Fairy fire affixed to the ceiling. Stepping into the closed Caravan you are greated by a wall of smoke as Alca begins to puff on a massive cigar. 

	`Ever been to Pixie city before`
	Beware place'll eat you alive maybe a few thousand years ago this place was a hallowed
	tree trunk, with Fairies dancing all over the place. Now its a cesspool of high chasers
	And Pixie Punks.
	You can't die here, alot of the pixies here are Land bound they can't leave the city,
	After a few thousand years you get tired of Playing chase, Most just try and figure
	out where the next dopamine hit is gonna come from

After about an hour of travel you try to peer through the heavily tinted windows and to your surprise notice the sun is gone. like it should be like noon. Then it dawns on you. Your eyes begin to identifiy its suroundings. It begins by noticing a strange striation in the sky as large as a cloud pointed straight up. you look closer at the stars and notice that they are in fact lights from houses.

You are looking at the inside a monolithic Tree 

Massive tree easily a few Kilometers or a few miles wide. and going impossibly high up creating a moon like hole at the top of this hollowed out giant tree

Its rather peculiar typically in architecture especially modern arcehtecture you have buildings trying to look plant like, vs this city where its trees that are attempting look in organic. White bark in the place of concrete. smoothed Mahogany bark for metal beams. All endges that would be in a building are just the tiniest bit smooth as these harsh angles are hard for trees to fit

As your gaze lowers to the horizon around, you notice a City with large towers attempting to pierce the sky themselves. The City itself seems designed around pleasure, and Leisure.


>[!info]- Future 
>Alca Pixie will task the party with stealing his Pixie pact from a Petunia Pix. 
>Petunia runs a huge Pixie Dust Operation inside the majority of Pixie City
>Her crown jewel of her operation is her personal night club The Bulb
>	As they arrive there is a killer on the loose inside of The Bulb but the pixies can't stop partying
>	They can side with either Petunia or Alca here. Petunia is the non-violent option that might even pay the players, however Alca is the honorble way, that will be able to get you stuff outside of the fey. Plus fairy promise might bite them in the ass.

[[The Bulb]]
