### Where the name sea of fallen stars came from.

There is one thing in all of exsitance that scares mortals, gods, and even dragons. Its space.... but more aptly called the void. Drakling songs tell us that in a time before this age, when dragons fought giants, and gods still roamed Faerun that something came from above. Something big, and scary. It took the combine might of all of Faerun's gods to trap it in the ocean. So it sleeps at the bottom of our oceans waiting. Dolby never liked the idea of something so scary out of view. But I suppose if those merfolk are still around then surely whatever it is can't be that bad.
