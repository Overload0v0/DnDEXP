## Here Be Beach Day Opening

#### Sailing through the sea of Fallen stars The Lady Pennance glides through this space like inky black water. The name Fallen Star Sea is apparent only at night when the water's Surface begins to glimmer and shine like pools of yellow starlight dangling above an infinitely dark abyss. These Glimmering Pools are made of tiny magical creatures called Bobbies. their nature is largely unknown yet their unmistakable beauty is well told across the lands. Just below the glimmering surface you see a sudden and ominous darkness that holds an untold amount of secrets and unknown creatures. The bobbies provide a decent distraction from the murky black below.
##### Its currently night, you've been sailing for 3 days now. It is now that we see Stars and Xanthe at the prow of the ship with Calicom and Xanthe's Cure on the horizon. You've finally had some down time recently in these three days, and most of them spent recovering.
