A day of roleplay adventure, is quite possibly the most apt way to describe last session. In session 19 in post named the beginning of an elven romcom and the rise of the rat king. Last time in the ruins the party discovered that the city was non too pleased with the destruction of the temple of Tyr. Who by the way, is the Triumvirate god of Justice. Surrounded the party made some last minute decision to split up.

The two went in completely separate directions for assumedly the same reason, A sir Clayton Alabaster, a Grizzled slightly hunky ex Mercenary that garnered the attention of both Xanthe and stars. Xanthe decided to turn herself in, where as stars decided to run and hide seeing how Clayton used to work for his father Sol Invictus. Xanthe was whisked away by Alabaster and his Cronies, while stars explored a deep underground sewer. 

Xanthe underwent a terrible interrogation that ended with her twitchy eared self rolling to seduce with her big ol batting eyelashes. Her seduction proved to be a little rusty as she was sent to a temporary "holding cell" typically reserved for the upper class. 

Meanwhile in the mud and the poo poo, Prince Invictus sloshed his way through the sludge of the sewers gaining and unknowingly contracting a horrible disease.

There they found mysterious scrolls and alchemical supplies. one such scroll was a mysterious Scroll of M M. They soon took a quick nap and awoke with horrible illnesses. Stars suffering from hag rot siphoning away his hp by natural means, and Xanthe awoke with the worst fever she has ever had. 

They went to find Luna in the hospital where she offered some good intel on possible alchemical solutions. Allusa root reverse the effects of whatever it is combined with, should they find an 2nd ingredient that would have to be the personification of Disease they might just have their cure. 

What they did craft however was a potion of Slow Curse, which gave Xanthe more time to deal with her nothism. 

After collecting Star's Sister, the trio went looking for the last piece of their puzzle a new engine for their airship. 
The encountered a Dr. Torpor. An eccentric and easily excitable artificer. There they were amazed by the wonders he had in his shop, that was until the price tag came out. Stars either in a need to speed things up or disregard for basic decency decided to attack Dr. Torpor. In a magical darkness the party heard the clinking of bombs falling to the floor as combat began. Now that we are all caught up roll for innative
