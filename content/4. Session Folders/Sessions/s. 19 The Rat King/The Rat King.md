Slinking and sloshing through the mysterious fluids found here in the bowels of the empire, you come across a large open of interconnecting tunnels. This large Cistern is strangely well decorated, You see disgarded pieces of drift wood has been banded together to build a rather small castle. nothing super big more like a rather large fort a kid would play in. 

Inside sits dozens of old baubles and knick knacks in heaps. you even notice adorning the walls are various rotten paintings that at one point must have been high quality. at the far end of the room positioned under the light of a well far above sits a wooden throne, in it lay a peaceful corpse in rotten garments, You would assume him to be a stereotypical homeless man, yet one thing strikes your eyes a silver crown upon his head stands out amongst the squalor around him  

Dozens of rats stare up at the crown but none touch the corpse, some leave and go about the day but it looks like all of the rats in this cistern take a moment when pacing to pay respects to the dead man eternally resting comfortably in his chair.
