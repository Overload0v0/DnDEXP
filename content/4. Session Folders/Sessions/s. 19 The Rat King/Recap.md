Last time among the mud and the blood, our hero's fought an eldritch beast of dubious creation. A False Hydra, summoned through a necromantic Deal signed between Galana and the Dark Masters. She sacrificed her dignity, integrety and very soul for the chance that the Dark masters might be able to bring her infant son back. Either through fault of her own or that of the summoning ritual, a strange and twisted malfeasance arose from her sons sarcophagus. 

Both alive and dead Galana gave power to something unheard of. A white Seperpant capable of feeding off memory. To protect it Galana Formed the Cult of The white serpent in hopes of protecting her abomination. Till her last breath she contained it, in a pit occasionally letting his essence out to feed on those in the lower city. 

However at the hands of stars she did find her last breath and with it the beast was unsealed. With clever teamwork the party destroyed the temple floor causing both them and the beast to fall into its final lair, the ritual room where the White Serpent Oolain's Human body lay. 

After destroying some idols stars himself came face to face with the Boy of false life, a sickly undead infant with a long twisting snake for an arm. Stabbing into the snake and the source of its beyond death power, The False Hydra Oolain disintegrated leaving not but an empty tomb. 

Our duo reunited discovered a door so primordial it could not be ignored. Following the path they ventured into an old forest, the first forest. Xanthe and Stars found themselves in the bodies of what could only be assumed where your past lives. 

Together they found the hut of a young felda, this one more aware and alert  some would say even kind. She introduced the two to the dark masters, where stars struck a deal. For Xanthe's Cure he must complete their task. As the walked away, they held a Coin of Madam Boodwan, with a special pecuilar charge.

Enter waycrest, underneath the 3rd bridge they see lay an orphanage. There speak with the children know their story, and the third child they speak to, Transport and care for them for 3 weeks. Simple enough, maybe too simple.
