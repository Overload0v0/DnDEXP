## Torpor's Mechanicus

Stepping into the light of day on the river docks of Caladin you find yourself horribly dissappointed. all river based crafts, with nothing more of note than the latest in Dingy technology. However just as you begin to conclude your search, you feel the ground shake and behind your a small puff of black smoke rises from a half constructed tower. 

Arriving just outside you notice that this appears to be a wizards tower under construction. unlike any you would have known before. The Tower itself as mentioned before looks half built only standing a loppy 3 stores tall with large tarps covering the top creating a sudo rooftop patio. Outside the large oak double doors is a deck surrounding most of the tower. On this deck appears to be several failed or forgotten projects of indiscoverable purpose. in the place of arcane ruins and advanced crystalline apparatus, lay large piles of metal, barrels of Turtle Oil, and many an arcanist books lay about. as you come closer you see a pair of mage hands slap open a window with great force letting a white plume of smoke billowing out the window from inside the tower. 

Meet Demayan Torpor. an excentric artificer with a flare for the demonic tech. A short and Stout dwarf of long white hair with a beard so twisted in knots it could never be untied. He wears a long blue coat with a blacksmiths Apron. He also is constantly wearing black tinted goggles.
