>[!warning] The Opening
Just as you were told under the 3rd bridge lay an orphanage. Baroness Ariel's Home for wayward children. Old and splatter with sea moss from the ever present lapping of ocean currents through the river streets of Waycrest. Where you expected a bustling hall of children you see is a lone and almost empty shell. Stepping inside the old school house there be a desk behind it a sweet younger woman with an overly excitable face. It appears that their are hardly any children here today, as they were shipped to beladon before the Giants could attack. There be a few last minute additions though. They should be in the back. Only 4 at the moment.  Suzanne Petrichor 10, Xander Regis 14, and Morgan Thomas 12, and finally Raven Cane 13. They should be playing in the yard please go meet them, We can discuss the logistics after. Its important for them to see people showing up.
>
Stepping into the field, you are in the Slightly a forest section of Waycrest ahead sits a hill you hear quite a commotion happing atop it. Just here you see what could only be the oldest of the bunch clutching his stomach running in tears, another hides behind a tree. poking his head out looking up at something.
>
as you approach the one hiding behind the tree sprints to you for cover WATCH OUT SHES CRAZY. Looking up you see a small teifling girl with horns jutted out on both sides of her head aiming a sling right at your head "what you blokes want."
