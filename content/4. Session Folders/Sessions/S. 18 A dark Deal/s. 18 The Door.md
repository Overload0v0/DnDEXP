#### Opening the door

the door has no handle or lock, the slightest push opens this dark pit. as the door opens it almost sounds like an exhale as stale wind escapes this loosely sealed door. 

Beyond it is an oak staircase leading downward into darkness, though deeply unsettling, there is a bit of an alure to it like the very walls themselves a sparking with potential. 


Stepping through you are in a large room with a circular basin above you. at its very peak seems to be a circular window, that at this time of night perfectly incapsulates the moon. With nothing but bright shinning moonlight you look about this old room in the corner there lay dozens of bones and debris in a pile and judging by the thick layers of dust all around, here they have sat for centuries. One set of dusty bones is located far away from the pile. Wedged into the wall you see a rotten skeleton. It is held up exclusivly by the gray deathly vines that seemingly hold him in place. As you step forward a green glow of magic resonates through the room as a thick layer of dust kicks up slowly.

All of this magic culminates into the skull of our vine striken skeleton. Slowly the head raises itself before issuing a warning.
