#Session16 #Session 

>[!tip]- Recap
>Last session could best be described as a bloodbath.
>
>Abord the Lady Pennance our party sailed straight for the dreadnaught. 
>
>On the approach Xanthe and stars collected their thoughts before the dreadnaught turned its eye towards them. Before the beam could even fire, Xanthe fired a few cannon volley's and stars helmed the ship straight into the side of the Lady Penance.
>
>After popping over the edge onto the deck of the dreadnaught Xander and the gladiators jump straight into ship combat. All seemed well until the ships captain stepped aboard the deck. A massive primordial force Oberon god of the hunt entered combat with xander as the party head below deck. 
>
>There Stars and Xanthe found a strange group of prison cells with strange magitech devices. Inside a Priestess of Teir by the name of lady Ethal, was undergoing a metamorphosis called the Nothism. Just before leaving Xanthe took a blinding blast of magical light to her eyes, that began the incredibly slow transformation. She discovered she could see secrets and peer into peoples past
>
> Moving through the room they encountered more fully developed nothics. They entered combat and quickly beat ass. 
> 
> The Final Room contained Non other than Apolita chained to a table, and Xena performing some elaborate ritual trapping apolita in a pleasant memory Xanthe Took apolita's sword and discovered that she could in fact unsheathe the sword partially. 
> 
> Attempting to open a new portal back to Faerun Xanthe began plane shifting, which was interupted by oberon dragging the near lifeless body of Xander into the room. 
> 
> Death Imminant Stars did the first thing that came to his head, Seduction. Sexy Lute in hand, coupled with a playful striptease. Stars successfully seduced oberon who mindlessly picked him up for a kiss. The moment the lips touched Xanthe's portal opened. Unknown to all the Gods of the Fey wild may never return to faerune so as the ship past thorugh the portal the two arch fey were ripped through the ship like opposing magnets. 
> 
> The Dreadnaught crashing Xena stars and Xanthe carrying her father ran through the ship to escape back to the Lady pennance. 
> 
> Xanthe failed the final jump and was holding on by only a rope. however she could not hold her father and herself and had to drop her dad. Before he could leave her forever she shot a rope arrow into his chest and with that extra help from stars there they held Xander suspended in air until the ship landed. Now laying in a field of grass in the wreckage of the dreadnaught our party rests

### Moving Forward

Folded Exhaustion takes over, your bodies pushed to the very limit, almost every spell slot, almost every hitpoint and all you had left to spare emotionally. In this unworldly exhaustion you fall into a deep sleep in the lush green grass as the sun shines overhead as your allies rush to your side.

In this deep sleep that Xanthe has not done in probably years where does Xanthe's dreams take her. 

	Tie in the swords calling

Stars where do your dreams take you

	The Gray Door leads to Cyric
		Opening the door you see a large rectangular concrete room. In the center of this room surrounded 
		by small bars stands cyric. this reveals his slender but cut build. He leans against the bars. 
		With a sullen suprise "You're going to lose everything, just like I did. And when all is said 
		Are you going to be as merciful as I was." 

________
### Beladon

After an unknown amount of time, you awaken to the sound of babbling water. The beautiful Hidden cobble stone room underneath Bella's inn in Beladon. On one end of the room Stars lays in a small twin sized bed, on the other side of the room an awkward 30 feet away Xanthe begins to stir. The room is almost bisected by a long tunnel that each of you knows leads to the Aqueducts that flow throughout the Town. On the other side of the room you see two tables that are littered with about a dozen books someone has been studying up. 

upstairs you hear several folks talking but non are as indentifable as Bella herself loud and bolstrous as per usual

Stepping upstairs you see moonlight beaming through the windows into this realitivly dark room. Night and the bars open means its probably around 4 in the morning. You see Bella behind the bar wipping down a mug, while you see Xena sloshed at the bar. Sitting in a lounge chair you see Xander trancing with eyes open staring into the fireplace. 

______________
Since Bella's inn sits on a cliff you see The lady Pennance docked right next to the cliffs edge like a boat in harbor. Sitting on the rails of the ship you see an angry luna who softens a bit when she sees you too.. As for the gladiators they are no where to be seen. 

"All up and left, roaming warriors and all that. Well was a lil rocky but atleast we still got the sword."

"We will barely make it past the Lambent coast with just the 3 of us, we need a crew of atleast 10 including us in the back-breaking work."

>[!info]- Traveling Mechanics as per written
>As is between Xanthe, Stars and Luna it will take about 3 days to reach Calicom. each day will require three roles from the group 
>1. Perception - Each day Someone will have to act as lookout, the Lambent Sea is home to all sorts of villainous scum
>2. Int - As helmsman their job will be guiding the ship through the inhospitable currents in the sky. One low role and you very well might delay the journey by as much as a day
>3. Sleight of Hand - Someone taking orders from the helmsman will be working constantly checking and restringing the rigging aboard the ship. A failure in this department could mean some malfunctions in the ship

As your ready the sails and begin your flight, you soon find yourselves lifted into the fluffy white sky. Soaring over the continent of Almyria. You finally pass over Waycrest before heading East towards the first stop Calicom.

As the ship cannot be flown at night due to the crew needing some sleep, The Party will have to settle down in the water at night.

You've been sailing for the better part of 12 hours, your bodies strained and tired from the constant supervision and hard work.  With a look of Nervousness Luna begins to take the ship down as you here the most gentlest plops of water bouncing against the hull of the ship. the ship begins to lurch from side to side signaling that the ship has now settled in for the night. Which begs the question where will you. Looking about the Ship you have the Captains cabin which is located on the deck that comes equipped with Luna's full library. 

Sitting above the deck on top of the mast is the crows nest which is constructed a little differently than most regular ships, this one appears to be more of a large bird cage that you can actually walk around in, nothing too spacious but it does have a roof. 

Below deck are the emptied crew quarters. the layout is very much Treasure planet as there are a variety of hammocks hung about the main cargo hold. At the end of the hall sits three doors. One a large Kitchen, another a spacious and meticulous armory, and the last some sort of office or treasury, which you can find Luna in a bit of a crazed state going over her books. 

Last but not least there is a hatch in the cargo floor which leads down to a warm engine room, that you would assume during flight is hot as all get, but right now radiates a lovely warm den of sorts. Where would our characters spend their times on this empty ship.  As the day begins to wind down, What would your characters being doing with their free time now that they have it.

_____

You are awoken at the crack of done, the sky still mostly dark save for a sliver of orange on the horizon, It appears that Luna has sounded the bell for departure. "ALRIGHT NO MORE WATER LETS GO UP"

Day 2: Perception The Lady Rose encounter. 

__________
>[!success]- Successful perception check
>Ahead in the distance between you and Calicom you see a medium sized ship just a little bit bigger than the Lady Pennance, its decorated with gold, and has dark brown oak planks. You notice it flies no flag, and that there is a woman aboard the ship in a big black hat shaking two white flags in her hands. 
>
>+5 or more | You see there is alot of movement abord the deck of the ship it appears they are getting ready. Perhaps loading cannons

>[!failure]- Failing Perception Check
>As you sail through the cloud stricken sky, you find it increasingly hard to get a good lay of the land, as there are too many clouds blocking the vision in the crows nests. Its FAR TOO LATE by the time you notice a large ship sattled up right next to the Lady Pennance. Though it could still be qualified as a medium ship, this one is a bit bigger than your ship. It is decorated with a bright shiny gold leafing and presents itself with beautiful dark oak planks. aboard the ship you see a full crew of about 30 running back and forth carrying barrels and other things. 


____
Amidst all the chaos you see an incredibly tall and muscular Half-Elf woman swinging two white flags while standing behind helm of the ship, she wears a long white coat with a long black hat. She has the brightest amber hair you've ever seen, and is beaming from ear to ear with a grand smile. "Ahoy there me comrades, If you'd spare us a moment of your time I'd promise to make it worth your while "

without skipping a beat, she steps onto the railing of her ship before grabbing a rope and swinging over to yours in one effortless move. As she gets closer she has these peircing catlike eyes

"Names Malady Areona but you may call me captain Malady. Running a bit of a skeleton crew are ya."

Say you folks wouldn't happen to be heading to Calicom would ya

Well I saw your poor little skeleton crew of a vessel and thought to myself well they'll never make it to port without the assitance of old captain malady. So What do you say for a meagere investmant we escourt you three into town sound above board.

"Being completly Honest here we were going to plunder ya vessel and make you walk our plank but my eyes don't exactly scream rich traders."

"How about this, Calicom is about a day away, your gonna run into a lot of pirates that aint as smart as ol captain malady. I'd be more than willing to do some honest days work and escort you cuties into harbor, ensure nothing happens to ya. lets about 100 Gold"
