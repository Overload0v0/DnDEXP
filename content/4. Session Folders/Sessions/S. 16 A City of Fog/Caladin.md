#Session
______
unfurling sails, and chartering courses, you few begin your trip across the continent to find Grand Cleric Galana. A uniquely divine individual said to be hand picked by Tyr, performing miracles across the country. Last heard she was in Caladin attending to the sick Emperor Godwin Omnia. 

This journey will actual be much shorter than your alternative. To go to Caladin would take you a day if no complications arose, and even then with the roads passing through the area it would become a two day walk. So it is still feasable if this doesn't work out that Zentari would only be a week and 3 days. 

As the ships sails I'll need three checks from the three of you has you desperatly pilot this thing on your own. 1 perception, one intelligence, and one sleight of hand. One for manning the crows nest, one for helming the ship, and one for handling the rigging. 

>[!example]- The Outcomes
>(Perception) - 14+ As you sail through the dark grey sky you see up ahead the city of Caladin. A city much similar to that of Cobblestone. It looks like the whole city is stacked upon itself, with the castle sitting atop this massive hill with it towers and turrets pointed high into the sky. Typically the white stone city reflects all light and almost glows but not today as a thick misty fog covers the city And for a split second as you look at the misty city you see some long thin white snake like thing coming from one of the burrows of caladin From this distance all you see is it's shiloute slowly wriggling in the sky before slowly dissipating into a strang of mist making your consider if it was just a vision.

Aproaching the white walls of Caladin, Luna comes forward "Religious blocks like this only like their gods flying, it also helps that Zenatarium and the Empire are in a bit of a cold war. I'll set her down over in that forest and head into town maybe grab a few sailors, she does allow you two to drop off just outside the city before she dissappears into the mists to the east.

_____________

Moving through the thick fog you see the orange glow laterns guiding you into the city. You approach a massive dark oak gate manned by 1 guard who looks very sleep as you too arrive. "What's your buisness here"

Molly's tavern just up the road be safe and welcome to Caladin. 

Stepping into the massive city of Caladin. in this fog covered city its more of a maze than most cities you've been through. and despite its massive size you notice very few people crossing the streats or going about there days. Quite folk some sulking some rushing from patch of light to patch of light. These people act more like rats in their own city than that of people. Despite the aimless wandering for a few minutes you do eventually come to a Tavern in big bold letters "Molly's Marvelous Tavern" The building itself looks brand spanking new, freshly lacquered wood, strong clean white stone supports. and doors and walls covered in the ever so spiraling Doodles of an artisian lacking skill but bursting at the seams with creativity like those mediaeval art tapestries. 

Stepping inside this massive inn you see there was probably room for easily 50 people but only 12 people are here silently eating and drinking talking in hush tones.

___

Behind the counter is a gruff older man with a thick bushy mustache. the bar is a beautiful brown color that looks like it is covered in more child like doodles. Sun shines rainbows funny characturs of various patrons of the bar. Almost in a daze Mr. Perkins polishes a glass.

"Molly... Molly.... Sounds familiar. Molly who. Aint remeber no Molly." 

"There are pleanty of shops in town to check out, You've got Helgi's Smithy, Calliope's Wonderium. then there's Annie... no Alia.... Aallia Well whatever their name was alchemy store on Lion Street. "
If you are looking for Religious stuff I'd say check in with the temple of the Divines its over in the white District can't miss it.

>[!info]- Direction
>To get an in with Grand Cleric Galana, your going to have to crash a wedding. Whos wedding? why the Prince of Caladin of course. Young Prince Henrick Omnia is marring the princess of Neverwinter Lady Aria Neverember. Officiating the entire ordeal is non other Grand Cleric Galana. Seeing as how the only way Galana would leave the side of the sick emperor would be to sactify the marrige of his hier, this is one of the very few times you would have access to her.

It takes you some time after devising some plans and aquiring directions, but you are finally able to leave fog town.
