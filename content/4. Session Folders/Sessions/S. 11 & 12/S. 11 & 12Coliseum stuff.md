#FeyWild #Session 
>[!info]- Recap
>Last time could be considered a five step kind of episode. 
>It began with our party flying out of Pixie City before landing in the fall land of Cadere on the outskirts of the city Elona
>Landing in the abandoned ward of Elona on a striking mosaic balcony that turned out to be a fauximaly of Star's childhood apartment. After some brief crisis you quickly learned that the Fey sits atop the mortal plane and can take the shape of things in the mortal realm. Which would mean that the nearest feyline exit would lead into the City of Sands Ennua Tetlon. After walking the streets Xanthe spoted a far off peeper watching where you all went. 
>moving past that you looked for the great witch but only found a Knife to Xanthe's throat
>After much debate over what they should do Xanthe "The Nut Cracker" Went for her signature move before the knife dropped quickly revealing her father. 
>After some wholesome talk and exposition Xander left the party with his blessing and coin to get themselves outfitted for the Coliseum. 
>Stars grabbed the Cloak of Gentleman a beautiful coat with magical pockets that could summon any item as long as it prephased with a phrase.
>and Xanthe aquired a much need upgrade on her weapon.
>After seeing a few portals open in the sky with flying and falling ships alike decending into the coliseum
>After heading their way into the Coliseum The saw a name on the register that gave Stars pause. 
>	Luna Domina Envictus
>	After some light shit talking they quickly fond themselves face to face with a relative of Stars he had never met before. 
>	After the events were announced our team hit the locker room before they are called to the coliseum

#### Locker Room

After you are rushed into your own private room you are finally given a moment to prepare yourself. You find yourself in a large stone room with a few windows that look out over the city that is surging into the coliseum rapidly. While the room is stone all of the furnishings and decorations are vegetive. Fungus circular table in the center, couches of daisy's and Mirrors held up by thick vines. 

On the table you a book titled "A Showman's Guide to Bloodsport"

>[!danger]- A Showman's Guide to BloodSport
>Blood.....Giblets...... and Spilt Bile. Arenas, Colliseums, and Fight Pits are the ever Industrious producers of this vile by-products of death. HOWEVER a true Showman never ceases or faulters in the face of Mortal Death. 
>
>Improv, Comedy, and Boasting are the Cure to the ailment of empathy in the theatre of Death. To win the Adoration of your audience you must understand that you do not fight yourself but instead for the Crowd. Remember that Winner may hold the Cup by the Showman even in Death lives forever. 
>
>The Book goes on to talk about stragems, and suggestions to better improve how you work in front of a crowd. It also talks about how duels are quite different from a battlefield. 
>
>On Each Turn for these Arena Fights, you will get more actions each turn. Essentially you know get an action, manipulation, and any form of speech. Manipulation means pushing, pulling, tripping and any other form of sabotage of your opponent. As for Speech that implies anything from a crowd appealing speech to casting a spell. Keep in mind you can still use your main action to cast a spell.
>
>So essentially you could Attack someone, push them down, then cast a spell. Or you could cast a spell Push them back, and begin listing their flaws and appeal to the crowd.
>
>For the Crowd Meter. The Crowd meter carries over from fight to fight, but each opponent you fight has the ability to lower. The way it works each time you succesfully appeal to the crowd you add a Dice to your damage roll. The Dice goes up for each success. So for example if you pleased the crowd once, you add a d4 to your damage but if you pleased them a second time after that you now roll a d6. This climb all the way to a d20
>
>Each time your opponent pleases the crowd your total Dice size goes down by one, 2 on a crit.

### Blade Twins from Avernus

A small brownie with his tears tied up like a pony tail strides into your rooms with such gusto and confidence. 
Plucky will ferry the party to the arena. Might try to rizz up beautiful

Moving towards the arena you feel the ground begin to thump,  and the ghostly echos of a crowd in the thousands bounces off the wall. 

Ahead a Blindingly bright light illumantes the dark hallway you walk through. Any last minute thoughts prayers, or preperations

Through the Maw of Bloodsport yo u step into the center of a packed out arena. The crowds themselves look like a rainbow of support. You see the Yellows, the Eladrin of Cadere Sing an old hunting song, the Reds is an army of Fiendish demonic on-lookers, There are strange twisting screams, accompanied by the most devilish guitar licks. Blue The nobility of the mortal plane with their assitants, stop their boots on the ground reverbing the whole stadium, And finally the greens are collection of treents, Brownies, and all sorts of fey and fey creatures having all sorts of chaotic fun. 

Plucky makes his way towards the center of the arena before grabbing a glowing orb and speaking into it. His voice booms through the round. "Welcome Fey and all to the 20th Fey and Follie Grand Melee hosted by the dignified and humble Arch Fey Apolita. We welcome our guests from the distant planes. Avernus, Faerun, and the Feywild. 

The layout of the arena a dusty bowl of red clay dirt. Several dozen Marble pillars about 20 feet tall cover the arena. Standing in the center of this pit are two human looking figures. Getting closer you notice their skin is covered with lacerations and crimson scars. The two appear to be brother and sister, The Brother has a stiched mouth and holds the most scars between the two, with vivid red eyes, and the sister is sleek and almost devoid of all cuts save for the crimson scars that line her head that almost appear decorative.

You see she holds the Gold mark on her chest that faintly glows. 

>[!danger]- Blade Twin Stats
>Brother blade has not means of properly attacking but he can cast a spell that links whatever damage she takes to him instead of her. 
>His health is 127 hers is actually 30 if they can break his concentration
>![[Pasted image 20231005155640.png | 600]] 
>Here is the twist. Each turn She gets 3 actions. Chain manipulation, Chain laying, and Chain attack.
>
>Chain Laying: Each turn she lays out about  5 by 1 squares of chain on the floor around her, entering these areas counts as rough terrain.
>
>Chain Manipulation: Any chains laid by Chain laying can move like snakes through the arena. Dex save of 14  or be pushed or pull 20 feet in any direction. 
>
>Chain attack means any chains nearby the target and Blade Sister can attack Each Chain does 2d4 and has plus 5 to hit
>
>She is primarily a medium ranged fighter does not like getting up in your business

>[!info]- Quips
>OOOH ya know despite being the blade twins these two arn't really that sharp
>Wow did you see that folks the way that Fey-Girl protected her friend, thats what a real ally looks like

"THATS IT FOLK in a roaring upset ---------- has taken the seal These two up and comers will be moving to the next round"

On your way back to the locker room adoring fans throw flowers and autumn leaves at your feet Before you can exit the stage, Plucky apparates before Xanthe before Putting a microphone esk device in your face. The Fey and the Feind, WONDERFUL showing today, what did you think of the opposition over this last round, so far the crowd's sentiments were that these blade twins were a little dull, any comment?

"Xanthe Next on the Bracket You'll be going one on one with Daniel Deberge from Waterdeep." 
Turning away from you facing the crowd Plucky kinda goes on an ad read. 
"Daniel Deberge 4th consecutive champion of the Cadere Melee, and author of a gentlemans guide to Bloodsport, #1 best seller reported from Baldur's time. What are your thoughts on fighting such an illustrious champion. Do you feel humble perhaps grateful for the experience."

Xander will be in the locker room helping patch each of you up. Apperantly daniel was a total loser back in the day. However now a days he is no joke, his crowd control is quite insane.

3 Dream Boat | You feel a bolt of fuzzy fleeling electricity running through your body, your body lurches. You feel an overwhelming Tick that must be sated. Much in the same way that a Truth Potion compels the truth out of you, you must Annunce and justify your actions through Rhyme the next turn
4 Bug Bite | a Terrible Bite Peirces your neck. 1d4 Dmg


_____

The Race of Champions. 

Stepping into the arena you see the Red clay dusty floor begin to fall around you revealing a new landscape of high variety in the circle of arena. One such zone seems to be a swamp of black ooze, followed by a rocky cliff that climbs high into the coliseum that is followed by a forest of bamboo,

>[!info]- Each Arena
>"Standing at the start line you look too your left and right and see the remainder of bracket 1 standing beside you. Amongst you seems to be a wounded arokakra, with massive fluffy wings. Moving down the line a Human Woman with a variety of mechanical Apparatus buzzing and whirring, with her Gnome counterpart strapped to her back. and finally Two Orcs with bombs strapped to their feet"
>
>All in All  210 Feet of course is setup here  starting with the 70 Feet of Each Zone. 
>
>### The Swamp of ooze.
>Bubbling ooze and noxious gas springs from the depths of this toxic Bog. You are looking at a good awful Abyss that will reduce your speed by more than half, and has a Poisonous slime that singes the very air. 
>
>	OPENING ACTION:
>		The Orcs begin to Jump from Tree to Tree clocking in at about 35 feet, The Arakocra begins to fly straight over the swamp and clears the entire bog at about 60 Feet so far, while bringing up the rear the human who seems to have a contraption that is freezing over the bog water, however she has only made it 30 feet in.
>			Maths : Orcs Escape Bog by Turn 2 exactly | Humans Escape by Turn 3 with 20 Movement left | Arakocra Turn 2  with 50 Feet to spare
>		
>### Cliff Side Climb
>Cresting the fog of the murky swamp, you come face to face with a rocky clay cliff about 70 Feet tall, Beside this cliff face are two marble pillars covered with vines that appear to be an easier climb but at the cost of having to make a 10 foot jump to the top of the cliff. 
>
>	OPENING ACTION
>		The Arakocra continues his assent up the mountain pass however his speed is slowed due to his injuries and the sheer verticle climb reducing him to just 30 per turn. The Tinkerers begin construction on a De-Vinci Esk Contraption and after the first turn shoot up to the top of the cliff incredibly fast. Lastly the Orcs arrive and ignite the bombs at their feet and GO ROCKETING towards the top of the cliff at the expense of losing their feet. As they rocket up, one orc will grab the Arakocra and begin trying to hold everyone back while his partner continues on the run
>			Maths: Orcs out in 1 turn, Arakocra out by turn 3 with 20 feet left, humans gone by turn 2 in an instant with 60 feet left
>
>### The Forest 
>After cresting the cliff you stand in a forest of green bamboo shoots. Somewhere crawling across the floor of this Green hell is an awful wounded and angry orc crawling across the ground towards the finish line. 
>
>	OPENING ACTION
>		Orc B fighting off Arakocra and trying to slow down the humans. Arakocra will will arrive at the Finish line by turn 4 After killing ORC B. Human Woman Gets wounded by her Gnome partner begins busting out a chainsaw and cutting down a large track all the way through the Forest. She will arrive by Turn 3. Orc A has the lead by will arrive at turn 2 because of his aliment meaning the party might be able to beat him with a Dex Check
>			Descripts : You quickly notice the green blood that blends in with the mossy grass at a distance, Somewhere in here he is limping towards the goal, too your left you hear the revving of chainsaw as a small gnomish woman and the frantic Squaks of a birdman behind you
>

As you begin to round the path of Green stalks you see it, the Golden checkered flag just within reach. Getting closer and closer, you notice a green bulk of mass desperately clawing his way closer with great tenacity  He is less than 15 feet away as he pulls at bases of budding shoots. 

Silence as the checker flies, and what is followed is a wave of applause sounding its way all across the stadium, in a roar so loud it deafens all noise to a single high pitch shrill. With the Fina Event of Day 1 complete The Winners are announced for the primaries and moving on to the final battle Xanthe and Stars are Victorious.

______

### A Night of Good Rest

Limping Bruised and Exhausted but in the best kind of way The feeling of being totally spent you u stagger you way through the streets of Cadere. Almost aimlessly from star's perspective. It takes a minute Xanthe, Its been not almost 10 years since you were at the family Door in Cadere. Eventually you find it. An old beat up broom closet on the edge of town into a derelict building. You grab a hold of the handle twist it and on the other side is a lush 2 story cabin in the woods Molded from trees. Stepping through it appears as though this door normally acts as some sort of broom closet,. 


The Wooden Boards creek beneath you in this spacious kitchen where Xander is Feverishly cooking some big pot of stew. Across the room appears to be Living room sournding a large Hearth to your left is a set of oak branch stairs that lead up towards the second floor that has 3 bedrooms There is a deck facing the now dark forest that is illuminated by only Lightning bugs and the moon. 

Sitting on this bench plucking away at a banjo Your Mom seems transfixed almost like she is weaving the forest into a new add on to the house. Your Dad Yells out "Aye ___ Little Me's Home" which is immediatlly followed by the crazest amount of clammering as she falls out over the floor rushing inside 

What Follows is a lot of Embrassing Xanthe Stories, They point to her first Arch-wolf Hunt on the wall. Her Tooth Necklace. Home Stew the full fixings

______
Its wrapping up towards the end of the night your father has drank an entire bottle of Zhentilian Wine, Stars probably took a few sips and got knocked out but your mom takes you to the deck before handing you an old box from underneath her rocking chair. 

"Did I even tell you about Jasca Company. We were specifically trained and outfited to lead Apolitas Armiies into the 9 hells. I never saw too much action but based on your adventures so far, I think you'll need it more than I."
She hands you a set of leather bound armor, that appears to have once been light infantry gear for the Daughters of Apolita some 1000 years ago. The Armor is boiled black but is covered some tinges of golden autumn color.The Armor has the mark of leaf on its back, with it appears self chissiled in names along the sides of it, almost not noticeable but you can feel the bumps and grooves with your fingers.

"Shes old and worn now so most of her exciting features as faded but if you allow her to grow with you, crazy things can happen."

____

As the two of you return upstairs the only spare room would be Xanthe's. However it kind of works out since Xanthe's Room does have a bed, and a hanging egg chair. Primarily becaause young elves have to sleep allow themselves to grow, and the meditation is learned later in life as a way to prolong aging. 

So the two of you settle down into sleep, in a way so satisfiyng you don't even need to slowly fall asleeep its just the moment you close your eyes you are out. 

Its midnight as the house rests in the cozy treehouse in the woods. We see several dogs cats trapse about the property but nothing moves as silently as dark figure clinging tothe shadows of night. 

The Figure gets closer to the house but leaping into a nearby tree and staring in towards Xanthe's room. Two Red eyes pericing the darkness look down at our sleeping party as it unsheathes a dagger from its side. 

Perception checks 20

it creeps closer to the window gracefully sllipping the dagger underneath and prying it up, it slinks into the room in a manor that implies it has no bones before rising next to Xanthe meditating in her chair. 

A cold Piece of of steel hovers over your chest 
Perception 16

## Picking up from Last Time: 
`Its late in the night in the living forest of Glow Worms, Puppy Bugs, and Juniper birds. All assortments of crazy creatures crawl, scuttle, and sing through this calm forest. That is, until a darkness begins to move through its very heart. It starts with the ever so slight retreat of fireflies and glow bugs, then followed rapidly by the sudden dissappearnce of all nocturnal song birds. In a brief instance the forest grows quite as a purple Miasma creeps through the forest. A Figure most sinister trapes from tree to tree. Dark Oily gauze wraps cover the creature's some what femmine form. Dark Clumps of Shadow seem to drip from the creature before dissappating as it jumps from tree to tree. Until arriving outside a 2 story log cabin of dark oak, and wispy vines. Its eyes trained on Xanthe. Like a Tar covered snake she slithers in through the 2nd story window up towards Xanthes Trancing Chair. She pulls out a dagger dripping in some viscous black sludge, with a red jewel on the hilt, A Dagger not unlike the one removed from Aunty Flora.`

Xanthe Your eyes open suddenly as this figure grabs your head and plunges the dagger into the middle of your back before throwing you to the ground.  You back Aches and Pulses as the Viscous Black Ooze fights the very blood in your body

Instantly things kick off the the the the, stars you awake instantly to find that Xanthe is being grappled and sliced at by some masked assassin,

>[!danger] The Assassin at midnight
>![[Pasted image 20231007164334.png]]
>
>Use Abilities sparingly
>HP 20 

Stepping Forward the Dark figure rushes at Xanthe and attempts to tackle you out of the window. 
Landing in the forest surrounding your house, the Assassin.

### The Finale 

>[!info]- Talking With Luna
>Amongst the Oiled rags of the infernal assassin you find a hand written Invitation from luna. "Seeing as how this letter is in your hands and not my own, it is to be assumed that my Herald has failed. You are much more resourceful than I once thought. Please join me at my ship docked in the Cadere Square.
>
>Boots click and clack softly against the Clay stone streets of Cadere, turning one of the endless corners you arrive at a large market square, Beautiful fabrics of blue and purple drape the Fabric cover the open Air Markets from above providing shade.  Docked above with blackened chains is a large scooner vessel esk Airship. Two massive metal braced horizontal Oval shaped balloons hold this ship up above the gentle market. 
>
>You board a ladder cast of to the side. The Crew that tends this ship perform mantience on the vessel less like sailors and more like zealots, every tasks seems to bbe a ritual, burning incesense, lit candles, and posted boards with several types of Text.
>
>A Small street rat of a human boy runs over to you, and ushers you over towards the captians Quaters.
>
>this room is all buisness, There is a black Oak desk in the middle of the room is littered with countless documents and maps. To the Right appears to be a battle map of Faerune With various Tokens in certain locations. There is a Twin Sized bed towards the back right corner of the room.  and all the way on the left hand side of the room is a beautiful dark wood bar, Where you sisters stands behind it fixing a drink. 
>
>Located on the bar Stars you see the very same files you saw all those years ago that made you go on the run. Its a creased up scroll with variety of Project details pertaining to a plan called Starry Night. On it is a list of instructions, Checklists, and notes regarding the creation of Malificur Tattoos. It was so disturbing because it charted everything you did across the day. That was a Synchronicity chart of expected actions. It appears they were mentally charting every move you would make. However The most disturbing thing you discovered was a memo regarding " The Boys Readiness to visit the Infernal Door"
>
> Luna looks towards Stars with an almost maternal kind of look. Apologizes for underestimating you stars. I was doing research on my opposition for tommorows fight, my people dilvered me this from father's palace. As of right now Only me and my now dead herald knew of it. 
> 
> #### Sol's Real Plan: 
> _______
> Most people in ignorance claim that teiflings are evil and of the hells. That we are tricky and not to be trusted because of our infernal linieage. Father being a sage happened upon some forbidden Lore. We are by most metrics evil. Our souls are claimed and we never knew it. Every Teifling regardless of devotion, has no soul to give. Our souls are bound below to the 9 hells. We expected to inherit our infernal abilities with no consequences. Profiting off a demons magic without any consequences was foolish on all of our parts. When we die we are tied to the prime evils. A slave race exclusivly to be a Devil's plaything. 
> 
> Father for all of his faults is willing to do anything to accomplish his task. It takes centuries to sway the hearts and minds of the other races, precious time we don't have. So we struck a deal with uncle. He would facilite the rite of Ardere Callem. Its just a plan, that has a primodial Entiety backing it. What he gets out of it, I'm not sure, but a secured afterlife is better than being a Devil's unwilling servant. All that we needed was Apolita to shift the spheres so we can finally get back at those damn devils.
> 
> However something intresting happened last night didn't it. She eyes Xanthe up and down. I didn't know Apolita had any little demi gods running around. 
> 
> Last night was supposed to be a kidnapping attempt, while also rooting out my opposition. However something interesting happened to our dear elf here. So I am more than willing to strike a deal. I will concede tomorrows guaranteeing your victory, on the condition you wish for apolita's sword. I do not take to wounding my pride lightly, however we do not have much time left until uncle arrives.

>[!tip]- The Blooming Brew
>A Noxious Bulb shaped building that bubbles out puffs of swirling purple smoke that seems oddly more animated animated as it swirls quite rapidly teeming with some alchemical magics
>
>Stepping inside you see more of a lab than a shop, dirty rotten wooden floors uphold this room of Alchemical Curios. Several older counters have dirty marble counters that hold strange apparatus holding loose filaments and bubbling concoctions. A table sits in the middle of the room is a pile of glowing Philters and Potions at different stages of Calcification and some Coagulation. Piles of Poultices, herbs and raw plants houses with glass pots. Standing above a pit of Glowing Goo gently tossing in mere pinches of some volatile reagent. A human Man in his mid 30s who wears a nice vest, with black slacks real Simon Petrakov vibes. It appears that half his body is covered in deep black veins "Apologies my dear would be patron, I am currently indisposed in a rather delicate form of Titration that requires my utmost focus, please wander the shop and leave the gold somewhere on that desk . You can call me Dr. Carmine"

### Potential Twist
At the end of the session Apolita either grants the sword or not. 
	Way Im thinking either someone dies at the last minute if they decide not to take the sword, or The take the sword and begin to open portals. 

- What if We kill Stars, and make Xanthe take the sword to follow him to the Gray Waste. "You can still save him, his soul is tied to the Gray Waste. It is a long shot but if you can find him and severe whatever connection binds him.Time moves quickly there, that is why it is called the wastes. A Day here is closer to a month there. its a realm without a god, a realm of decay and wasteland. "
