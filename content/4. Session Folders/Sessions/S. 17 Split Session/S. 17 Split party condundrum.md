Collecting themselves they ventured upstairs to encounter Xanthe's parents in a much worse state than they were the day prior. Pleasantries exchanged and advice given the two saw a fire growing behind Xenas eyes. Revenge, Jealousy, frustration... impossible to tell but an anger gazed down on Xanthe from her mother. 
>
>Departing the inn our party wished to visit Felda only to encounter a mysterious woman living in her shop. After a quick assessment and conversation it was revealed that this was Felda's daughter on the run. Warnings exchanged the two left with cursory glance over the shoulder gleaming some disturbing green wink coming from Annie. 
>
>Later in the morning they encountered Luna who made a geniune effort, all be it, poor at an apology. forgiveness exchanged the three loaded up the lady pennance and set sail for the next destination. The City of Caladin. Home to the Empire and the seat of the Divine Order. 
>. 
>They arrived at dusk shrouded in a thick ghostly fog, Before Landing stars witnessed something he couldn't quite comprehend. far off A thin white snake-like tenticle breaching one hair head out of the fog. In that moment thinking more out of urgency for Xanthe he decided to hold this informationi until they entered the city of forgotten names. descending down their latter Stars and Xanthe made way into the mysterious city of fog. 
>
>Walking through the eerily quite metropolis they repeatedly found cases of Memory loss, forgetfulness, and more importantly missing people. After stopping in Molly's Tavern for direction, they made their way to the white district. Two major things happened here. 1 Xanthe was able to communicate with her goddess and in this communication she saw a horrific vision. One of a blood lusted Apolita beating Oberon to the brink of death in a city of flame.

Tyr and his Knights proved incredibly dangerous and before the party could flee. Galana entered. She no longer saw you two as a threat and had conversation.

>She offered to cure Xanthe for the location of Sister Ethel. It would take a few months to clear her body of Nothism fully. However Xanthe's insticts proved her correct something was wrong in this town, she could not stay here one more day, let alone an entire month. 
>
>On the way back to the ship, the two made plans to fly far from here. They hoped to even buy an new engine to speed up the process. This conversation was cut should, as they saw a shop that looked uncannily similar to Feldas.

>Deciding to give a shot, they spoke felda in hopes of finding a cure. Felda tasks the two with aquiring a young woman by the name of annie. That if they saw her to give ol Felda a holler. Departing the store they made their way back to the Lady Pennance to rest up for the long journey tomorrow. We last left off with Xanthe failing an incredibly important set of rolls.

Our session begins on a ship nestled in the the thick piney woods outside Caladin. Just far enough to wear the towering spires come in and out of view with the wisping fog. The ship is resting all of its crewmates asleep in their rooms. all but one. Alone in the top of the crows nests we see Xanthe comparitivly to the the black and bleak color palate of the ship she looks like a raging torch of orange Trancing at the top of the ship. You are up high enough to where the fog sits just beneath you like a white ocean  that sprawls in all directions for miles. There you Trance. Far from her vision boobing up and down through the top of the fog a long white neck swims towards the ship. The Face is covered in long oily black hair that hangs incredibly low obscuring the face. It gets closer and closer to the crows nest as Xanthe fails every check. all until it is but mere steps away from her face. 

It appears as tho nothing will wake her from this trance, until the sounding of soft Melodic (Melaaa dic) coos.
Opening your dreary eyes you are face to face with this black oil mass of hair. The hair begins to wriggle out of the way like worms, and reveals the pale white face of a little girl with dark black eyes stars at you. 

The eyes turn into white spiraling tendralis that lure you into a hypnotic gaze. Its all rather funny at one moment you saw this abhorent monster but then you see it slowly fading out of your vision. Kind of like when you wake up with blurry eyes, every blink makes it go away more.  As the vision fades you see less and less detail of the monster but funny enough you see more dozens more coming from the fog. You feel yourself forgeting, Forgeting what you saw, the danger in front of you . You know it in your chest the danger is still here but you don't have that much time before even your instincts leave you what would you like to do. 


Stars give me a perception check as you sleep below deck. Its not impossible but the music that bounces up and down the corridors of this ship has a chance of reaching you.
