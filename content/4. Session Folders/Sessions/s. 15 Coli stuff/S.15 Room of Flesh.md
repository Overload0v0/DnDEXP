#Session 
_____
After moving through the Zhentilian ship, you find yourself in the bowels of the cargo hold. The Living wood becomes more viscous and flesh like, as your foot steps squelch underneath you. You are on the far side of a room of pink flesh. Massive tumorous eyes implanted in the wall stare at you on the opposite side of the room. In the center of the room is a pentagram used for some sort of blood ritual, and atop that is a small table and chairs. We see Apolita shackled in Iron to this table. She looks horrible. beaten and bruised. There is a deep wound in her chest. You see one ruby Gem sticking out of her chest.
