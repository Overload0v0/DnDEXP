Thusters are shot, the ship is coming down. However there is still a problem. Oberon is still on board and if he survives this he will be loose on the city. You're gonna have 10 turns before the ship hits the ground, despite all that, you know one thing and one thing only. if  oberon is abord. Aint NO WAY he isn't a little hurt... maybe even. a little vulnerable.

A Thunderous crack resonates under the floor of the dreadnaught. The once sputtering green flame, flashes on and off before one last breath of air before the lights go dark. In a moment you feel a weightlessness overtake you. The ship begins to dive.  You have about 3 turns before the crash, being a thousand feet in the air. Now typically things in dnd fall 500 feet per turn, but the dreadnaught is currently tied to Luna's Lady Pennace which is slowing the fall. which if not dealt with each of you will take 20d6 which I did a roll before hand that came out to 86 in fall damage. I'm more than happy to do a re-roll but that's the threat. 

as the ship nose dives towards the ground, you are not looking down the deck, you see the sails are helplessly flapping in the wind. various ropes and tools begin to fly off the deck. about 100 feet behind you is the lady penance being dragged down with the dreadnaught by the only thing holding the two vessels together, a thick rope that apparently was worth every single coin they used to buy. 

Finally their is still the issue about landing location. As the ship tips you look down and see this ship is going to land in the market district, a highly populated area of Elona. You see a beaten and bloody Xander is desperatly pulling at the helm trying to redirect the ship. 
	Investigation check - He is pulling at the wheel that seems to be in an incredible bind, you look about the ship to look for whatever the problem might be, you notice there is a line of rigging that has wrapped around one of the secondary masts. If you could cut that line Xander might be able to steer the ship into the Amber lake. 
	however the mast is in a percarious position hanging over the edge of the ship. 
	lastly a thought pushes through your mind, if apolita opened a portal, the ship could land anywhere but a populated city, maybe she might be able to fix all of this.

### If they Crash in Elona
In a brief flash, the world below grows large. It felt like one moment you were so far above, then in an instant your mind boggling speed is now well apparent as the an explosion of wood erupts before you. The ship hits the ground and it looks like its practically liquifying before you until it touches the man engine. A massive green explosion unlike any you have ever seen. of dizzying height. A green ploom washes over the City. Windows shatter, foundations shake. And the Autumn city Elona is forever changed. 

	If they Die: Fighting even to the last second our heros valantly fight Gravity, destiny, and Malicious Arch-Fey. In a moment much like in the ballroom less than 3 hours ago. You two look to one another. Looking into your dear friends eyes you see until an explosion of wood chips englufs your entire gaze. Your body is thrown in the chaos, beams of wood breaking across your backs and chests. sharpnel firing into your like a machine gun before a massive explosion of green throws you several hundred feet. The chaos all in all lasts about 30 seconds, buch each second feels like an eternity. Eventual you a flung threw a building, no sign of your adventuring partner, as your vision fades. Its time to roll that 20d6 with a constitution save. If you pass that damage is halved, but you fall unconsiouces.
