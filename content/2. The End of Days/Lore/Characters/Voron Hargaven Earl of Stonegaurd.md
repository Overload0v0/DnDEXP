#### History
	Not much is publically known about Voron or the Hargaven's for that matter. The only known fact about them, is the Hargaven Family has been around Stonegaurd almost as long as Peratrease has exsisted. Emerging into the public eye Voron's first move was the complete finacial support of the Marquess's Dempain Edict. The Marquess in thanks raised Voron to the title, Earl of Stonegaurd. Many years have past and Vorone has not made any other large public debutes. The Orium Trading company has announced record high profits in spite of the Empire's Collapse.
