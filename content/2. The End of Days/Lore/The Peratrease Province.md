At the Edge of the Empire of Brovia sits it's most placid & uneventful province Peratrease. Sharing a border with the ominous and dangerous Burukai River, Peratrease stands on the edge of civility. During the collapse of Brovia Peratrease found itself forgotten amongst the Civil Turmoil of the collapsing Empire. How coinvent it is, that Peratrease alone is unshaken by civil war, fully independent from the chaos on the mainland. And with this Placid and Uneventful air surrounding this province, It now finds itself the seat of power in the Lunar cost. All who dream of peace, have dreams of peratrease. and with that comes immense influence. Overnight Peratrease became what the empire had lost. Yet there is one question at the back of everyone's mind. How long until the civil war finds itself at their shores

>[!important] Nobility of Peratrease
>### In order of importance:
>1.   [[Marquess  Jean-Pierre Dempian]]: The Ellusive Ruler of Peratrease ever enraptured by the goings on of his local court. Few lower than nobility have seen Dempian, yet most would know his face from the statues and potraits of the man ever presently decorating the homes and forums of Peratrease. All images depict him as a man in his late 40s that exudes a youthful jovial spirit. He has blonde quaffed hair with a razor thin Pencil mustache. The best earthly reference would be something close to a Gomez Adams.
>
>3. [[Voron Hargaven Earl of Stonegaurd]]: Crafty and mischievous Voron spends his days plotting either ascension or the downfall of his enemies
>
>4. [[Oolain Teravive Earl of Penulia]]. : Oolain is completely devoted to the Church of Light. Since the Schism Oolain has tripled her efforts to support the church turning the Southern end of Peratrease into an theocracy and operates her holdings with the help of the High Inquisitor of Light.
>
>5. [[Grand Inquisitor Gallana Evermore]]: her visage is known through the empire, by 30ft tall posters, and threatening leaflets dropped in the hands of the empire's citizens. Gallana has long brown hair, with skin as smooth as a doll, in contrast this woman has seen more battles than most beings alive. To go through all that without so much as a scratch, she is surely blessed by the gods. wearing incredibly thick heavy armor, with scrolls and parchment of various biblical scripts adorning her armor. Almost as the religious texts would protect the armor. She carries a massive gray mace, that she lifts aloft with eyes glowing a gold radiance. It is proclaimed that she can see the hearts of men, and know their truth. The Grand Cleric turned paladin, seeks to reunify the church by any means, and religiously has a chokehold on the people of peratrease.
