title: Introduction to "Behind the DM's Screen"
---

>[!info] Introduction
>This website acts as the public library for notes regarding my Dungeons and Dragons Campaigns. As of Right now there are only two separate campaigns running, "Of Fey and Fiends" & "Crowns and Scepters {tbd}" 
>
>Here on this site, I will be posting lore documents for the beginning of the game. I will also drop more lore documents here as time passes. The ambitious side of me wants to do a news letter of events happening in the world but that sounds like alot atm.

>[!warning] FYI THIS ISN'T REQUIRED READINGS
>None of these documents or lore dumps are required readings at all. Its my belief that ITS FANTASY MIDDLE AGES it would not be expected for any random peasant to know the goings on of their own kingdom let alone global politics. We might know shit cause we are always watching the news and our phones, but not the stereotypical peasant.
