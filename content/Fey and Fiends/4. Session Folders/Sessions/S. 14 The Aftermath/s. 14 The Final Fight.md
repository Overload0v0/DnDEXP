#Session
_________
>[!info]- Recap
>Last time in a purple smoke a Tar covered assassin moved through the Forests of Cadere towards Callie's childhood home. In the depths of night, the assassin slinked inside and stabbed Xanthe with a corruption Dagger. The very same used to infect aunty flora. After waking up Xanthe Found herself in a deep rage, as Stars is thrown through the window the Trio enter a heavy skrimish. 
>Retreating downstairs the party finally killed the assassin before it was able to attack Xena. Amongst it's oil rag remains was found a letter from none other than Luna. This letter was invitation to parley. The gang rested up and head out the next day with Daddy's money. After debating on what to do for preparations the settled on finding Felda, maybe getting some answers. After meeting with Felda they got their tarot read and were able to trade their corruption daggers for a primordial Melting Pot with the ability to combine most if not all items. 
>They Drew the Tower card before leaving much to Xanthe's Dismay
>
>After Speaking with Felda, The party went to meet up with Luna. Arriving at her ship better known as Lady Penitence. The Meeting with her went in any direction other than what was expected as the Grand plan is revealed. It appears that the souls of Tieflings are permanently tied to the 9 hells, and no matter what none can escape that fate. This discovery drove Sol to near madness, now he does any and everything he can to reverse this regardless of who gets hurt. The Costs justify the Means for Sol if it means salvation. However at the turn of the conversation Luna revealed to Stars that she would happily throw the fight if it meant that Xanthe Wishes for Apolita's sword. With a green glint in Luna Eyes was all Xanthe needed to know there was more than what was said going on. 
>
>Tabling the potential deal, the Duo separated from luna, AS you turned for the door she said They had up until the duel to decide, if they agreed to enter the arena with their swords sheathed, she would concede if the weapons are drawn before entering the arena, then that would mean they don't have a deal.
>
>The Session wrapped up with a quick visit to a shop called the Blooming Brew. They met the proprietor, a dying Alchemist by the name of Dr. Carmine suffering from a disease called Arkanite Rot. The Party looked about is Emporium of Strange chemicals and Potions. The party put their noggins together and used Felda's Primordial Pot. They created a few interesting items, such as a Leaf blade wrapped around Xanthe's Arm, much like Finn's Grass sword. The Party was able to craft a specialized fey cap mixed with heavy Iron. This one shroom was enough to complete neutralize the Arkanite Rot in his body. 
>
>However It appeared that the Rot was still present just dormant. Gleefully Dr, Carmine begged the party to assist him in amputating his arm. Xanthe Missed a little bit but really chopped off the mans arms, and  in return he gave you everything in the shop. 
>
>The front door of the blooming brew opens followed by a tiny chime rings accompanied by Two adventures Ladden with alchemical loot, The party looks towards the Fall Tower as a Bell sounds signaling the Fights start soon.

### Intro
Deep bassy bells sound through the streets. Xanthe you can tell the time of the final fights has come because you see the celestial bodies in the sky begin to spin quickly much akin to that one scene in Moonknight, before settling in the late afternoon. That part of the sunset were everything appears a purple haze with streaks of Orange and red. 

As our party makes there way towards the Coliseum, you feel flashes of the last couple of days, Intense revelations, quick decisions have been made. People are better and worse for it. What are the thoughts going towards our parties heads as we approach the final fight.

________

After the Fights The party is summoned to the Autumn Spire to receive their reward. 

_____
The Autumn Spire is a sleek full marble tower with Blood Orange accents. At the top of the spire is a large bulbed shaped room. 

You enter a long tall Spire, that apparently has no stairs but instead a small pool of water, and a circular room that goes up and up for several stories. Stepping into the pool you feel your body begin to lift as you are leviated for what feels like minutes towards the top of the Spire. Entering the Blub room is truely a sight. Kind of like that elven city in lord of the rings everything here kinda has a glow to it, there is an almost 360 Degree view of the City, with a Simple but regal wooden Throne at the North end of the room.

There are a few dozen Courtiers hanging about drinking a strange collection of Drinks. The moment you arrive a wave of polite appluase resonates across the room. It would appear this crowd was watching you efforts from up here. 

Sitting in her thrown is Queen Apolita herself her armor is removed and she wears a white tunic with long flowing golden hair. atop her head sits a beautiful amber crown, and to her side is an incredibly rusty sword, that stands out as a sore thumb or perhaps grevious reminder to all in the room. 

"Champions of Cadere you do us a great honor. I promised you a wish within my power to grant and a wish you shall receive however I may only provide 1 wish. Should you not be unified in your resolve, one final duel must take place."

____________

Quotes: Friends show their love in times of trouble, not in happiness." and "Life has no blessing like a prudent friend.

_________

As the wish is made, and apolita sets to work on its fulfilment, a grand party takes place. One in which you may dance and mingle amongst your sponsors. A certain merchant from Varuvia is hard at work trying to chat up Xanthe for perhaps a sponsorship, while the two of you look out amongst the city. Silence reigns as the bells signaling the departure of our extraplanar guests. Airships begin to take to the sky and perpare themselves. All Ships except Lunas. 

Just as Apolita readies herself to finalize the wish, you look out over the city of Fall, There appears to be a bit of a commotion by the portals. Something has happened there appears to be a jam. Nothing of consequence surely.  - Sound Effect- A massive green light bisects the room. and in a moment everything goes dark.  Xanthe you're in a weightless darkness almost Like you are in the deep end of a pool. Stars yours is much more concrete quite literally. as you sit once again in the deep dark gray pit, sitting along side that pathetic pitiful dark haired figure. He looks at you with a deeply intense sympathy. "I'm...  im Sorry. This is my sin to bear not yours." "I cant see past the lock and key, but something bad has happened to you." He reaches a hand out for yours

_____
A unknown amount of time passes before you two awake. You lying on the cold now jagged Marble floor of the Bulb. The floor is utterly shattered and just barely being upheld. You look to your left and notice where once was a ballroom of Courtiers, now is is nothing, it appears that half of the room has been obliterated. 

Tables overturn fires breaking out. You look out over the city to see a massive airship hanging ominously in the sky. Its balloons are ripped, and its sails are in tatters, but a ghostly green light seems to hold up the mega structure. It has rows after rows of Cannons that seem to be in different stages of firing into the city with green puffs of smoke. On the deck of this ship you see a massive cannon like device charging before emitting yet another blast of green energy this time into the coliseum.

Looking about the room you see just a handful of Elite members of the court seem to be hollering in anguish either from injury, or circumstance. The elevator is out with no apparent way down. the situation looks dire indeed. There appears to be some sort of ground battle outside the coliseum on the champions steps You look around for apolita and she is no where to be seen. 


The Ground begins to shake as the Courtiers desperately look for a way out, However the elevator appears to be broken. Current sit rip. Apolita is missing and the spire is Beginning to sunder. There is an infernal Airship laying siege to the city, and a battle happening by the coliseum.

_______

Spire Falls. You feel the ground beneath you begin to churn, loose stone begins to shift the spire won't last long. 

Its about 60 feet up, however there are about a dozen buildings in the area the tallest being a 40 foot library. However due to half the building being disintegrated there is a chance you could climb down. 

The final route immediatly before you is a long shot. The Airship attacking the city, makes rounds, during this it does a great sweeping motion, there is a chance that you could jump and possibly misty step onto the anchor and then climb into the ship. It will be dangerous but it would get you inside possibly stopping it. 

________

Fires break out across the city as you run from borough to borough.
