#City #Session22 #Pirate

##### Re-cap: 
Last time was by far the most chill and and filler arc esk episode, our death defying duo have experienced chaulk full of fishing, drama, Emotional talks, and relaxing days telling stories with the crew. And then suddenly almost as if to snap them awake from the last few idyllic days you encountered a dragon born trading vessel under seige by 3 dragons, We had a tense stand off between Xanthe and Stars as they fought over wether or not they would stop to save them or flee to safety. 

In the end stars won the argument and good thing too as a massive dragon bit the ship clean in half and soared off. Later that night alone with her thoughts Xanthe Fished into the dark night with morgan when she spotted golden lights on the horizon the shining pirate city of calicom is near. and with it Xanthe's Cure.

>[!info] Docking in Calicom.
>A large but fractured island in the middle of the Lambent Sea. Old and mystical you see long forgotten stone ruins that act as the Cornerstone of this city. You see large fissures have cracked through the city, but instead of retreating inland, it looks like the ran-shackle buildings have expanded into the cracks. In the center of this city sits a building very out of place. A large Overgrown fort with an exquisite Palace in it's center. Though both look like they are desperate need for upkeep, this has not detered the crowds that flock to it. Its bright golden lights radient through the  foggy night as the brightest sight in the sky. 
>
>This is without a doubt a city of Carnal Pleasures, the capital of Pirates, the home of Mercs, and a Den of Greed. Huge Zaun vibes if you've watched Arcane
>
>After looking around you find space at the docks. A nice and quite dock with the only sound being the plops of water bobbing against the dock. The whole dock is gated off from land, with barbed wire to deter stow aways, but there is a small booth with a sign that reads check in. Past the fence and booth you see a busy and lively street with the occasional blast of a powdered musket accompanied by laughs and jeers. Behind the counter of this small booth is possible the oldest halfling you've ever seen with the biggest bushiest mustache and eyebrows so big it covers his eyes. Much like the dad from cloudy with a chance of meatballs | BUBBA |

>[!danger]- Crews For Hire
>There are three Quarter Masters representing different mercs. 
>1. The FallenGaurd
>	- Wearing light dirty armor, this group of knights look like disgraced Vanguard. Perhaps they were fired for vices, maybe they got left behind after a campaign, or perhaps they cracked under the immense pressure of Vanguard Standards. They have a sense of Honor about them, but obviously they wouldn't be here if they were truely honorable.
>	- Behind their table is a red head Knight wearing light plate armor. She hair is a bright red that has a bit of a poorly done shoulder cut. "Miss Marena Fitts of the Fallengaurd. If you are looking for a good fighting force you've found the best. I can Tell by the look in this ones eyes, you've got something worth fighting for, money will hold my men down for now. But what they truely want more than anything... redemption, can your cause do that for em. However they are not the best sailors but they are profecient."
>2. The Reavers
>	- The most pirate looking pirates you've ever seen. Black vests with poofy brown aladin esk pants, wearing scimitars. They are a collection of pirates that either between crews or never had a permenant crew.  They are the best of both worlds good at sailing good at fighting, however there is no garuentee that they won't double cross you
>	- Mr. Scruggs doesn't sit behind a table, because Mr. Scruggs aint ever bow to no man in his life. However in this world respect is all thats due between folk. Looking at ya scars, and you gaze I'd reckon you'd sooner kill anyone in this bar than let your ambitions be squashed. I respect that, and I respect you. The reavers are yours if you can pay. You know the risk higher my boys, but word of advice. Democracy was born on the seas. You play right and earn their respect, they'll be more loyal than any Vangaurd.
>3. The Bellowman.
>	- Mainly made of dragonborn and kobolds, the bellowman are the most intense of sailors. Easily the best sailing crew you can find, however professional these men and women are, there is no true guarantee they will not backstab you. On the other end of that spectrum these are hard working career sailors and will not be so easily swayed by any glinting peice of gold. The other side of this coin is that since they are career sailors, they hold no intention in dying, and will quickly surrender if boarded.
>	- Bulby the Kobold.... If hired I will assign you the best Dalengaurd has to offer, with our help you too will hoard vast riches. 



>[!warning]- Games
>- **Twenty-One (Min 25 gp buy-in).** A player rolls 2d10. The dealer does the same, keeping the first die hidden. Each player, including the dealer, takes turns rolling any number of additional d10s. All die faces are face value, except for the 1, which can be worth 1 or 11. If the dealer scores a 21, all players lose. If a player scores a 21, they win. If neither occurs, a player loses if their total is less than the dealer’s, and wins if their total is greater than the dealer’s. Payout for winning players is 3:2. If both the dealer and a player score a 21, that player wins their bet back 1:1.
>- **Hand of Fate (Min 50 gp buy-in).** A player rolls 1d12 and keeps their roll secret. Each player has the chance to raise the bet, call the bet, or fold. This continues until all bets are equal. A d12 is then rolled which all players can see. Each player has a second chance to raise, call, or fold. A second and final d12 is rolled and each player gets one last chance to raise, call, or fold. Once all bets are equal, all dice are revealed. The player with the highest combined total of their die and the public dice wins 80% of the pot (20% going to the casino). Ties split the 80%.
>- **Gypinee (Min 5 gp buy-in).** A player rolls 2d6. If they roll a 7 or 12, they win. They can double their bet to add 1d6 to the total. Payout for winning players is 3:2.
