>[!info] Miss Orian Library of Curiosity
>Inside is a beautiful yet dusty Wizards Laboratory. It looks like at one point this had been a series of Rooms above the inn that had the wall between the two knocked down for Miss Orian's ever growing need for more lab space. Inside you see almost a dozen tables pushed up next to one another in a couple of rows, each table housing a new type of experiment either Harmonic, Alchemical, or ritualistic. 
against the walls of this room, you find about 8 bookshelfs side by side against the far wall, fill to the brim with old dusty tomes and scrolls
