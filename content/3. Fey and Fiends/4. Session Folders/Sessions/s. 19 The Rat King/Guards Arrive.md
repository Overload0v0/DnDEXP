## Guards Arrive Non to Pleased at What They See
>[!todo] Descript
In the bottom of a crumple Cathedral of Tyr you stand victorious and reunited With a clear heading. Its here than twilight breaks, tho in the depths of these ruins you see the stain glass windows far above you begin to shine the cathedral with a rainbow of light. The sun is rising, the fog has cleared, and even way down here you can tell the sky is beautiful clear blue yet again. In this moment of Serenity you hear Horns begin to sound
>
The Chaos covers the streets above as you hear a military force begin to muster looking for the reasoning why their beloved Cathedral fell. It is now that the gravity of what you have done settles in. You are standing in quite possibly the greatest Known disaster to ever face Caledon. the city should have no memory of the monster you just slough and you did play a key role in the destruction of the chapel. You either have some high and mighty explanation to do, or its about time to high tale you way out of here.
>
Easily hundreds of soldiers flood the Ivory District. In the Belly of this Disaster you don't see many ways out, You could face the music as it were and try to talk your way out of this, tho the consequences of failure would be astronomical. Towards your right Lay abusted sewer pipe leading through the city about 4 feet tall, So long as you don't mind a little treck through sewage and muck alike it could be a safer option Tho who knows what you might encounter, Sickness or Greasy Rodent.
