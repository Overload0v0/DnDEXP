# Here be Dragons
Sailing through the deep blue sky, you find yourself in a cloud patch of sorts. Cold Crisp air on your face you sail in and around the big fluffy clouds of white. Yet as you sail you begin to notice far off bells ringing  
##### -Perception Check 15- 
- Through the Crows nests you notice all the way on your far right a ship is being sequestored by 3 red dragons, spilling fire onto the deck and attempting to mount the ship. You even see the most rarest of moments as one of the three changes to a dragonborn form to storm the ship. A singed and desperate Lookout rings a bell in the crows nest for help. You quickly notice this is a Zentarim Ship possibly shipping some great goodies. yet most interestingly its flying Black Mire Flags, more specifically the Dragonborn capital Elabin. 

##### Should they Choose to Fight the Dragons
They Will enter combat with two Young red Dragons against their ship, My hope is that the ship gets really damaged maybe stars falling out of the sky. However even if they do crash, the trading vessel will return, if the dragons are defeated they will give the party a parting gift of 300 Gold, however if the ship crashes and they loose. They will still get a reward as the dmg they inflicted was enough to encourage their retreat after securing their horde. This rewards will be an obsidian Pendent depicting 3 claw marks.
