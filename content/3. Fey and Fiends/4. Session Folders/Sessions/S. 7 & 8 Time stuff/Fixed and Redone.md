# A Slip in Time
#FeyWild #Session ______
In a state of Eudaemonia you stand in the gapping maw of a reality torn asunder. You felt as though you stood on the precipice of a million worlds and timelines, like on the fringe of an open train, with one footstep solidifying yourself in the state you land. In one such world, You had remained a victim to fate, traped in this Virlimisitude You left into a world of Fey unlike any you had seen. Only one such fate awaited you a fate of your own design. The First thing nagging your mind in this Falseness between reality. Your nead to breath. With one step You appear in the white snowy lands you eerily know well. Stars you feel as though the Aug, but there is a swelling in your chest, watching the path your other you went, a route of no escape. The freedom from the chains of Fate is not so simple however. Looking about the the Grove of Silver and Arcane power you feel as though the trees are less bright, and the sky is less of a white and more of a steely grey.

This world is different, and that sinks into you as the wreathing flames adorn your shoulders as the mantle of flames trains behind you, instead of the bright orange they were before , now a cool refined blue. The occasional drop of snow sizzes off of you but this is a more controlled fire. A chance to control your fate. 

You both stand upon a blue icy hill looking down into the glade of Gilders Gleam. This time no hut, nor pot of steamy tea, an empty ominous white field of White.

### Perception Check 14
silence permiates the fields around you, making it all the easier to pick out that something moves in these wood. Something big and fast. As your ears whip around to track it, you catch the tail end of patches with black oily fur pulled taught against an emaciated frame. Whatever it is, it is large but wirey in build. 
###### If Failed:
"You feel the hairs on the back of your  neck begin to rise as the feeling of something watching you washes over your back and neck. 

Just out of View away from your inquistive Eyes a black oily figure climbs through the surounding brush stalking, watching it slowly begins to slink up one of the trees reveealing its massive but also thin wirey frame. "

With your Recapturing your sense of self and direction, The other senses begin to follow. The Grove is by all means different than either of you would remember. A thin fog trapses the white floor of the glade. Where there was Fluffy beds of snow are now slushy amalgamations of Icy compact floor. Each step sounds as though you step on wet marble with a soft echo that reverberates through the woods. There is no magical blue hue, it almost seems as thought the trees themselves are absorbing whatever light shines in this gloomy forest with the only saving grace being the white floor beneath you. There is no Sign of Flora, or any sentient presence here for at least a month or more. You hear the light banging of a drum with the shaking of murakkas far off to the south.

While it is a direction to possible towards, you know it would lead you away from the brightly lit grove into the twisting dark that is the path South.

To the east however you see a bright campfire in the distance, about 30 minute walk, but you know there is atleast someeone in that direction


>[!question]- Finding the Elves
>after a short walk, you find yourself at the perimeter of an eladrin camp. There are 3 of these elves that seem to be up and about getting ready for something. They wear golden armor and despite being subjected to this dark forest their armor still finds a way to shine. Tho the light doesn't travel far of their breast plates before being swallowed by the surrounding pitch of the forest. Two of these eladrins wear golden hoods across their heads, with wooden masks representing different wildlife, one a boar, the other a deer. The 3rd Eladrin wheres the mark of Oberon on her armor, and carries a mighty looking iron sword wreathed in an orange flame with a silver shield. She does not have on a hood of any kind but instead has a font of golden hair trapsing down her shoulders.  Xanthe you would know these to be Knights of Oberon. 
>Boaris, Detri Footfall and Allana Chimestil  
>"Good Morrow Kinsman, If you wouldn't mind stating your buisness in these woods."
>"We are searching for an old friend, Flora the Guardian of Glilder no one has heard from her in weeks. "
>"We suspect something to be stalking us in these woods, We camped in it's territory in  hopes of luring it out, nothing so far. I suspect our hunt is more intellegent than I gave it credit."
>Boaris Chimes in " I think it be some twisted dear I saw its horns and fur " Deitri Counters, No way it was larger than that, I feel as tho Itd be an Feykin Ape I remember seeing a large hand grabbing one of our horses" 
>"We've been hearing noises to  the north, So soon we're packing up and heading that way see if we can end this charade. Possibly find out if the creature has anything to do with the Disappearance of Flora" 

>[!error]- Meeting Uncle again for the first time
>Following the sound of Marrakas and drums you arrive at a clearing, in the center it seems as tho there was little snowfall here as what snow there is on the ground has mixed with the dirt below making this dirty brown look across the ground with scatter twigs and branches. In the center, the same jester from your Augurey of a different time. A smallish figure that seems to have been feathered then dipped in tar dances about the center of the clearing he hops around almost weightlessly with its arms and limbs falling in strange ways like a dolls would. Upon stepping out into the clearing the merriment of the dance quickly ends. loosely he turns to speak revealing the same white circular mask with this time a painted frowny face, with only the most essential details. 
>	-Perception Check 16 - 
>		You notice in a glint of moonlight thin Strings of Sinnue seem to be coming off of uncle and into the branching web of trees that is the cannopy above. Just as the gears in your mind begin to unravel this mysterious man, you begin to notice that the voice is not coming from "Uncle" but instead somewhere above you. 
>So you want out of the family business' do you. That's frustrating but quite understandable seeing as how you've tried to escape fate before. But Willing is the most important part of the prophecy. unfortunatly for you I will be needing those tattos back. You see The oily figure before you collapses like a puppet who's strings had just been cut.
>	-Perception Check- 15 
>		As the puppet drops you immediatly see the snow from the branches above you falling here and there as something begins to crawl its way through the trees towards you. You notice a hand the size of a door attached to skinny Emaciated arm rapidly decend above stars and attempts to grab him. INTIATIVE

### Fighting with Uncle:
Each of his turns he will attempt to try and hide between rounds before jumping out and grabbing somebody 

`You feel the Guant Hand of rottin flesh grab onto your digging its claws into your armor before ripping you into the sky with a strength uncanny in proportion to its reduced muscle mass. It pulls you into the thick web of Baren branches before shoving you into a pile of spiny branches stabbing into you and hooking your clothes. You are here face to face with the beast that calls itself uncle. It immeatily begins to envelop you and begins pulling and ripping at your skin.` 
	 -Con Save 14- 
	 It eagerly and with no reservation begins clawing at your face and torso, but you successfully block and cover the majority of your vital organs. Strangely enough you see a red glow begin to shine from its chest, just as the light becomes more visible You see it a dagger located in center of its boney chest grows more and more red it clocks that you've noticed and immediately discard you and tosses you from the trees dealing only 1d10 damage 
	 On a success it rolls from the injury chart 

>[!danger]-
Injury | Discription 
--------| -----------
Minor Scar | Its massive claws begin to slice across you face temporarily blinding you from the blood before disgaurding you on the dirt below 3 d6 damage. These wounds will leave a scar
Major Scar | From Chin to Stomach the beast bites down into your torso causing a fountain of blood to rain from above the trees deeling 3d10 Dmg. This will leave a massive noticable scar
Limp | You feel yourself begin to fall through the nest of Branches and barbed vines before landing on your stomach on one of the branches below, before you can pick yourself up you feel the beast land on your back and bite into your leg for 1d8 damage. This gives the character a limp and reduces their movement speed by 10
Deafening Scream | Almost Overwhelmed by joy it feels in the gruesome task it performs the creature grabs you by the shoulder and pulls you close before uttering the most shrill Scream you've ever heard until nothing is left of your hearing but a high pitch whistle

The Fight with uncle is Brutal but uncle as an entity is too much for his hosts body and begins to glow from its source point which just so happens to be a dagger in the center.
